    Why I Built a Static Site in Clojure
  </h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Published 2018-09-15</p>
  <div>
    <p>At a summer barbecue, a friend asked if I could build a website for his
new restaurant. But what he didn't know was that I haven't built a
static site in nearly a decade. However I couldn't let him spend
thousands of dollars on a cookie cutter website designed by a firm that
knew nothing about his restaurant.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>We started coming up with ideas right away over a couple of beers. He
wanted manageable content, an Instagram feed, and an easy to change
restaurant menu. It quickly started sounding like a full on Content
Management System and not a simple website. I had to reel in this
ambitious project before it became a feature sink. So we decided to just
make a beautiful static site.</p>
<p>I started using <code>Wordpress</code> to build the website because I've used it
in the past and it's easy to expand. With a list of dream features in
mind, a basic website quicky emerged. But as it grew, themes became
complicated to build. Plugins were ugly and difficult to customize. And
templates were clunky to use. I couldn't continue with the <code>Wordpress</code>
route.</p>
<p>Having been spoiled by component based systems, I decided to try
<a rel="external" href="https://github.com/zeit/next.js/">Next.js</a>. I use React in my day job,
so it's familiar ground, but I couldn't justify the complexity for a
website that didn't need dynamic content. Also, <code>Next.js</code> had no CMS
support.</p>
<p>That's when I decided to reach for
<a rel="external" href="https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup">hiccup</a>, a Clojure library for
generating server side content. <code>hiccup</code> let me use Clojure data
structures to build my pages.</p>
<pre class="giallo z-code"><code data-lang="clojure"><span class="giallo-l"><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-comment z-comment">;; generating a span element with the class `foo` and content of `bar`</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span class="z-punctuation">(</span><span class="z-entity z-name z-function">html</span><span class="z-punctuation"> [</span><span class="z-source">:span.foo</span><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-string z-string">  &quot;bar&quot;</span><span class="z-punctuation">])</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This short syntax let me express more with less code. I also had
components.</p>
<pre class="giallo z-code"><code data-lang="clojure"><span class="giallo-l"><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-comment z-comment">;; defining an `h1` variable with the content `Welcome`</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span class="z-punctuation">(</span><span class="z-keyword">def</span><span class="z-source"> header</span><span class="z-punctuation"> [</span><span class="z-source">:h1</span><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-string z-string"> &quot;Welcome&quot;</span><span class="z-punctuation">])</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-comment z-comment">;; using `header` variable inside a `div` with an additional paragraph</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span class="z-punctuation">(</span><span class="z-entity z-name z-function">html</span><span class="z-punctuation"> [</span><span class="z-source">:div.content</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span class="z-source">       header</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span class="z-punctuation">       [</span><span class="z-source">:p</span><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-string z-string"> &quot;more content&quot;</span><span class="z-punctuation">]])</span></span></code></pre>
<p>I could define functions or plain variables, then use them as components
in my templates.</p>
<p>On top of that, I didn't have to learn a special syntax for working
with data. I had the full power of Clojure to interact with data and
components themselves.</p>
<pre class="giallo z-code"><code data-lang="clojure"><span class="giallo-l"><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-comment z-comment">;; defining data for the menu</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span class="z-punctuation">(</span><span class="z-keyword">def</span><span class="z-source"> menu-items</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span class="z-punctuation">  [</span><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-string z-string">&quot;Crab Rangoon&quot;</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-string z-string">   &quot;Pot Stickers&quot;</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-string z-string">   &quot;Miso Soup&quot;</span><span class="z-punctuation">])</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-comment z-comment">;; creating a function to generate a list elment from the provided `menu-item`</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span class="z-punctuation">(</span><span class="z-keyword">defn</span><span class="z-source"> create-menu-item</span><span class="z-punctuation"> [</span><span class="z-source">menu-item</span><span class="z-punctuation">]</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span class="z-punctuation">  [</span><span class="z-source">:li.menu-item menu-item</span><span class="z-punctuation">])</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-comment z-comment">;; generating an unordered list by mapping over the `menu-items` data</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span class="z-punctuation">(</span><span class="z-keyword">def</span><span class="z-source"> menu</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span class="z-punctuation">  [</span><span class="z-source">:ul</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span class="z-punctuation">   (</span><span class="z-entity z-name z-function">map</span><span class="z-source"> create-menu-item menu-items</span><span class="z-punctuation">)])</span></span></code></pre>
<p>I could do all this with a concise syntax that is simpler than Wordpress
templates, and shorter than React components.</p>
<p>The final benefit is the ease of mind provided by Clojure. I know that
no matter what features we dream up, they will be possible with this
general purpose language.</p>
