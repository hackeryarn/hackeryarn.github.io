Engineers want to measure the quality and effectiveness of their work. They
turn to code coverage, burn down charts, and yearly goals, with the best
intention.
</p>
<p>
These measurements provide quantitative data about how much planned work was
delivered, but they fail to tie the work to outcome. What good are 1,000
lines of code if the users never use the feature? These metrics distract from
the two question every professional should ask:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Did my work deliver measurable change?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Did I stay within the constraints?
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Everyone is familiar with the concept of measurable results. Others have written
and talked extensively on how to measure the right thing:

</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
But the second question, around constraints, may come as a surprise. As
engineers we have an aversion to constraints. We think they limit the quality of
the solutions we deliver.
</p>
<p>
In reality, it&#39;s not the engineer that finds the best new tool that&#39;s highly
regarded, it&#39;s the one that gets the results with what&#39;s right in front of
him. The developer that mastered his domain brings more value.
</p>
<p>
As we dive down the rabbit hole of new tools in search of perfection: timeline
double, bugs get introduced, and the whole project comes to a screeching halt
because of the mountain of tech debt.
</p>
<p>
The expert engineer, on the other hand, is careful about introducing new tools.
She doesn&#39;t pull in a library for left pad because she knows how to write
that code. Her scope for new bugs is small so when she introduces one she
quickly finds it, in her own code.
</p>
<p>
OK, most of the time the search for new tools doesn&#39;t get that bad, and the expert
engineer is a myth. But the price of looking for a way around the constraints is
very real, and we should strive to be more like the expert engineer.
</p>
<p>
In this article I want to cover the most common constraints I come against 
and provide the techniques I found to dealing with them.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-1">
Not Enough Time
</h2>
<p>
Whether a bug came up, an outage happened, or we just underestimated the work,
we constantly come up against time constraints. It&#39;s the nature of a job in a
highly complex domain.
</p>
<p>
The easy solution is pushing back the feature. We can finish it at the beginning of
next sprint because we work in small incrementsâ€¦ Right?
</p>
<p>
In my experience, time constraints rarely become an issue if the tasks are kept
small. As long as the tasks are kept small, features get delivered every
iteration and no one gets upset because the application progresses forward.
</p>
<p>
Time constraints become an issue when we take on too much work at once. When the
timeline is up and we have nothing to show. We might be one bug away from
delivering the features, but that doesn&#39;t matter if the stake holders get
nothing.
</p>
<p>
To prevent this situation, you have to break the all or nothing mentality. When
you realize the task you&#39;re working on is too much; stop. Reevaluate the
requirement.
</p>
<p>
Go back to the stakeholders with the goal of figuring out smaller chunks hidden
in the details. Pareto principle states that 20% of the work holds 80% of the
value. When features bloat, it&#39;s up to you to figure out the 20% that will
deliver 80% of the value. You can revisit the rest later, if needed.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-2">
Missing or Changing Requirements
</h2>
<p>
Before you can be effective you need to have clarity of the expectations. To get
clarity you need to ask questions.
</p>
<p>
Your question will result in one of three outcomes:
</p>
<p>
If the feature is high priority, you will get to have the needed conversation 
and gain clarity. This will let you start work with a better idea of what&#39;s
expected and minimum down time.
</p>
<p>
A much worse outcome, but all too possible, is that you can&#39;t get anyone to look
at the feature. When this happens you should question the priorities. If it&#39;s
not a high enough priority to define well, it&#39;s not high enough priority to work
on. The work is endless, your time isn&#39;t. See what else is needed and select
a task you can accomplish.
</p>
<p>
The third options, and the one you stand to gain the most from, is that the
feature is high priority but the users aren&#39;t sure what they want. When this
happens, you get the chance to create low fidelity prototypes, explore new
approaches, and get into a creative mindset. Working through this process with
users allows you to learn about them which result in better understanding on all
future work. The return on the time you investment is enormous.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-3">
Unrealistic Expectations
</h2>
<p>
If your stake holders are non-technical, like they often are, you will
inevitably come up against ridiculous expectations. &#34;It will only take a couple
hours to add authorization, right?&#34; These expectation may even be your own
doing. If your application is well build and easy to use, it becomes
indistinguishable from magic. Everything seems easy from the outside.
</p>
<p>
But don&#39;t get frustrated by these requests. They provide another chance to
connect with the stake holders. This time, allow them to understand more about
your work. Compare and contrast features and explain why this feature might take
longer than another.
</p>
<p>
Once the stake holders know the work required, they will give you more time or
pick a feature they can have sooner. The important part is, to educated the
stake holders so next time they know the scope of a similar feature.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-4">
The Right Tool for the Job
</h2>
<p>
The notion of &#34;the right tool for the job&#34; echoes through every office.
Unfortunately, it&#39;s misunderstood almost as often as it&#39;s uttered.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Right</strong> doesn&#39;t mean perfect. It means the tool that enables you to accomplish
the job without wasting time. It even changes depending on the person or team.
</p>
<p>
If a team knows nothing about a language used to implement the perfect tool,
they could spend weeks learning enough to implement the solution. Sure future
work may get easier, but will the amount of future work justify the investment?
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, if they use the language they know and add library that gets
them 80% of the way, they can give the users results now. Then you can come back
to evaluate that perfect tool with a better knowledge of the alternative.
</p>
<p>
No matter which option you pick, remember that every new dependency needs careful
consideration. Your team has to learn the tool. You have to make sure the
tool is maintained, or has clean code so you could take on the maintenance. You
have to verify that it works with the rest of your dependencies. If this sounds
like too much work, consider implementing the features you need yourself.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-5">
Technological Limitations
</h2>
<p>
This is the most surprising area of frustration. Many of us have gone to school,
or spent vast amount of time, to learn about optimizations, data structures, and
algorithms. We learned about these so we could deal with technological limitation.
</p>
<p>
When you come up against this limitation â€“ like processing speed, memory
limits, rendering speed â€“ it&#39;s not time to dispaire. It&#39;s time to celebrate.
You finally get to dust off that old book and figure out a tough problem.
</p>
<p>
The important part, for those around you is that you set realistic expectations.
There won&#39;t be a quick solution. It will take a significant time investment.
</p>
<p>
Once the expectations are set and you get to start the work, consider yourself
lucky. These challenges don&#39;t come along often. So dive in and enjoy the
learning.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-6">
Wrap Up
</h2>
<p>
This isn&#39;t an exhaustive list of constraints. These are just the once I fight
with most often. Still, I hope it serves as a reminder, to you and me, about how
lucky we are to work in a field that allows us to solve problems every day. To
enjoy the process, we just have to expand our scope of what problems we are
solving.
</p>
