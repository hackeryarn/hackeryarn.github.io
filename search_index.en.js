Outside of work, I write Rust, contribute to open source, maintain a Kubernetes homelab cluster, and dabble in 3D printing and hardware.\nIn the past, I taught software engineering at Washington University in St. Louis, and worked with web technologies, across many industries, since 2006.","id":"https://hackeryarn.com/about/me/","title":""},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/async-python-benchmarks/":{"body":"The Python community is abuzz with excitement about better async support. If you have an existing service, you might wonder if you're missing out. Benchmarks show higher throughput and promise the ability to handle more requests with less hardware. Will a switch to async be a free lunch for your existing service?\nAs often happens, the reality differs from expectations. Unless you run in a highly distributed environment and your service is the bottleneck, needing 10 instances just to keep up with all the traffic, you probably won't see the benefits that most benchmarks promise. In fact, you might see worse performance by switching.\nBenchmarking method\nThe disconnect with 80% of services and async benchmarks comes from the general design of the small to medium sized services. The most common services talk directly to a database and as traffic increases, the load on the database grows much faster than the load on the web service. This load distribution shifts the bottleneck from the service to the database. To see the implications of async under these conditions, we need to examine benchmarks that mirror the same configuration.\nThe setup for these benchmarks involves Django with a PostgreSQL database. Both are the some of the most popular technologies in the world. Django gives us the ability to easily switch between sync and async configurations. While PostgreSQL gives realistic characteristics for the different types of load we want to simulate.\nFor another point of comparison, the benchmarks also include FastAPI. It's a newer framework built from the ground up for the async era.\nTo get a full range of service conditions, I test three scenarios:\nStatic content: Runs the service with a database setup but no hits to the database.\nDatabase read I/O: Queries the database to read data and uses that data to generate a response.\nDatabase update I/O: Creates high contention in the database by using SELECT FOR UPDATE and locking the table for an update, and use the results to generate a response.\nTo run the benchmarks, I use the same method as the article (which pushed me to write this post):\nGranian as the server since it can run using threads or processes.\nUsing the command granian --interface &lt;asgi or wsgi&gt; --workers &lt;1 or 2&gt; --blocking-threads 32 --port 3000 &lt;application&gt;.\nI wanted to include free-threaded benchmarks here, but psycopg cannot run with free-threaded, yet. Once support lands and stabilizes, I will make a follow-up article that includes free-threaded benchmarks.\nrewrk to run the load test.\nUsing the command rewrk -d 30s -c 64 --host &lt;host with route&gt;.\nSystem76 Darter Pro as the laptop for test execution\nNixOS unstable\n12th Gen Intel® Core™ i7-1260P × 16\n64 GiB of RAM\nPython 3.14\nPostgreSQL 18\nI show the most relevant code snippets in the article, but the curious can find all the code here.\nResults\nThe results include four different project configurations:\nSync Django: Default Django setting running with WSGI.\nSync Django Pooled: The same as Sync Django, but using a pooled database connection.\nWhile setting up the load tests, I found out that Django does not pool connections by default, but it does require pooled connections to run in async mode. This configuration closes the configuration gap between the sync and async setups.\nAsync Django: Default Django settings for async mode running with ASGI.\nFastAPI: Default setting for both FastAPI and SQLAlchemy.\nI chose to use the JSON output here, despite the Django benchmarks not using JSON, since it's the most likely use case when running FastAPI in production.\nWSGI and ASGI are the production-grade web servers suggested by most python web frameworks including Django. WSGI handles synchronous services, while ASGI handles asynchronous services.\nStatic content\nGetting a baseline of static content gives us an upper bound of what each configuration can do without the database to slowdown the server.\nThe sync and async Django views look almost identical. We only need to add the async keyword to make the async version work:\nThe FastAPI implementation is just as straightforward:\nServer typeWorkersRPSLatency avgLatency maxMedian\nSync Django1503213ms7162ms20ms\nAsync Django1551116ms193ms129ms\nFastAPI1262872.43ms9.38ms2.72ms\nSync Django2661410ms802ms15ms\nAsync Django2112057ms133ms72ms\nFastAPI2373531.71ms7.25ms2.43ms\nThis table does not include Sync Django Pooled because it makes no difference when we don't hit the database.\nThe most obvious thing here is that FastAPI far outperforms Django across all metrics. The developers behind FastAPI worked hard to make sure it performs well under these exact conditions, and it shows. Now that we addressed the elephant in the room, let's focus on the more nuanced Django benchmarks.\nThe RPS (Requests per second) metric has a couple surprises. Async Django performs an order of magnitude slower than Sync Django. Async isn't free, but this massive difference is surprising.\nThe async version starts making up ground with smoother scaling than the Sync Django version. As we add workers, we see a modest increase in throughput for Sync Django, but a doubling throughput for Async Django. This shows how async can queue up work in a more consistent manner and start catching up with many service instances.\nWhen it comes to latency, we start to see an advantage of async request handling. Async Django has no outliers and a median close to the average. Sync Django, conversely, sees massive tail latency slowdown. The slowest requests take over 100x longer than the average.\nThe latency metrics shows an important tradeoff between the two configurations. When we use async, we trade average performance for consistency. In many scenarios, we should make this tradeoff, but with a 10x slowdown from Sync Django to Async Django, we have to weigh the option carefully.\nDatabase reads\nNow that we have a baseline for each configuration with no bottleneck, let's connect to a database and perform some reads.\nFor the testing schema we will set up two table: an Author table that will contain the names of people, and a Quote table that will contain quotes by the authors. This gives us a straightforward layout, but makes the queries more realistic by adding a relationship traversal to every request.\nThe Sync Django view looks like:\nThe Async Django view just needs a sprinkle of a few async operators:\nThe FastAPI view fully relies on SQLAlchemy to perform the search and returns the results as JSON:\nAfter introducing database operations, the metrics include both pooled and non-pooled Sync Django configurations:\nServer typeWorkersRPSLatency avgLatency maxMedian\nSync Django1456140ms262ms153ms\nSync Django Pooled1569112ms171ms117ms\nAsync Django1205312ms467ms331ms\nFastAPI1236271ms372ms287ms\nSync Django266996ms262ms132ms\nSync Django Pooled2182235ms98ms50ms\nAsync Django2541118ms304ms196ms\nFastAPI2409156ms433ms224ms\nWhile looking at these benchmarks, we have to remember that to a large degree we are load testing the database. The difference in benchmarks comes from the overhead of each framework and the different approaches to waiting for data to come back.\nThese benchmarks show much more interesting results. The overhead of managing async requests and async database calls really starts to show. Sync performance ends up far outperforming either of the async benchmarks. Even FastAPI starts to lag behind when we introduce a database.\nWe also see a massive performance improvement by making sure we pool the database connections. The two worker Sync Django Pooled more than doubles the RPS performance of any other configuration.\nThe latency evens out across the board. Since PostgreSQL becomes the bottleneck, we don't have to worry about the bad latency characteristics that we saw in Sync Django. PostgreSQL, and most popular database engines, are battle tested across many scenarios so we can rely on good performance characteristics.\nContentious database writes\nWhile database reads run quickly and predictably, they do not show the worst case scenario for databases. A DBA's worst performance nightmare comes in the form of contentious writes. These happen when an application needs to lock rows or an entire table and ends up having transactions that wait for other transactions before they can run.\nWhen improperly managed, this situation can lead to dead locks and whole transactions erroring out. In fact, we will not see benchmarks for FastAPI in this section because, despite my best efforts, I could not get the application to run in async mode without deadlocking. Flipping FastAPI to sync mode seemed to go against the spirit of the rest of the benchmarks, so I wanted to avoid that path. If you can figure out how to get this running, I would love to get a PR and update this article with those benchmarks.\nTo create contentious writes, we will add a views field to the Quote table. This field will store a count of how many views the quote gets. Every call to the endpoint will increment the views count before returning a result. To ensure that the field value stays consistent, we need to lock the row with SELECT FOR UPDATE. Due to many requests running at the same time, we will end up with requests waiting for other requests to complete before they can update the views field.\nTo implement this, we wrap the whole view in a transaction, use select_for_update, and update the views field before returning the results to the user:\nThe Async Django code follows the same general pattern, but we have to split out the transaction because Django does not support async transactions at the moment:\nServer typeWorkersRPSLatency avgLatency maxMedian\nSync Django1170376ms2144ms542ms\nSync Django Pooled1149429ms576ms460ms\nAsync Django1156408ms542ms427ms\nSync Django2170375ms5168ms620ms\nSync Django Pooled2160401ms951ms584ms\nAsync Django2169378ms824ms518ms\nThis benchmark turns out to be the great equalizer. All the benchmarks have almost the same RPS. Even when we add more workers, the contention prevents us from processing more requests.\nAlso, our latency problem with Sync Django came back. Compared to async, Sync Django has much higher tail latency. The interesting part came from Sync Django Pooled. Introducing database pooling solved the sync latency problem without the need for any code changes. This puts the sync configuration on equal footing with the async configuration without any code changes.\nConclusion\nThese benchmarks show just how much optimization for sync web services Django and the Python has. Sync Django Pooled outperforms or matches all other configurations. Even FastAPI only performs better when it's the sole bottleneck.\nIf your service talks to a database directly, it is unlikely that your service is the bottleneck. To get the best performance you should stick with a sync webserver and ensure that you pool your database connections. As the ecosystem stands, async introduces too much overhead to make sense. This will shift as async support continues to improve, but for now you probably don't need to go changing your web server.","id":"https://hackeryarn.com/post/async-python-benchmarks/","title":"What async really means for your python web app?"},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/cli-in-emacs/":{"body":"A few months ago, Gabriel Gonzalez wrote an excellent\narticle\non creating useful tools with Haskell. He used an example of a small CLI\ntool that aligns the equals signs of a multi-line text input. The\narticle wrapped up by integrating this tool into vim.\nI love the overarching concept in the article: create small tools that\nare useful in multiple contexts. It's directly inline with the Unix\nphilosophy.\nThe only problem is that I am an Emacs user. So in this article, I\nwanted to show how I get the same effect in Emacs. And demonstrating how\nto take CLI interaction in the text editor even further.\nTake Action on a Region\nIn his article, Gabriel uses the command he created to take action on a\nregion. This involves selecting text and executing a CLI command on\nit's contents -- replacing the region with the command's output.\nFor this example, we will use the command from Gabrial's article,\nalign-equals. To see the full implementation and learn a little\nHaskell, you can read his\narticle.\nOr you can follow along while keeping the below command's usage in\nmind:\nEmacs has a built in command, shell-command-on-region, which executes\nthe specified command on the selected region. This would work for our\nexample, but it requires two commands. First you execute\nshell-command-on-region, then you provide the command you want to run.\nIf the cli command needs flags or arguments, it becomes tedious to put\nin every time. Wouldn't it be nice if we could select a region and only\nrun one command?\nTo accomplish this, we need a wrapper. This implementation combines a\ncouple elisp components. We start our function by expecting the\nbeginning and ending of the region as arguments. The region(r) flag\npassed to interactive ensure that the correct arguments get passed in.\ninteractive lets us invoke our function from anywhere, and supports\nmany more\noptions,\nwhich I encourage you to explore on your own.\nWith our region bounds ready, we call shell-command-on-region to\nexecutes a shell command on a region specified by the beginning(b) and\nending(e) arguments. We also supply the shell command to execute, and\ntwo flags which make the command replace the selected region.\nWe can expand the CLI command in this wrapper to take any number or\narguments and flags. No matter how we change it, we can still invoke it\nwith one command: &lt;M-x&gt; align-equals.\nTake Action on a Buffer\nA common scenario I run into, is wanting to run a tool on the whole\nfile. This normally comes in two variants. I either want to modify the\ncontent of the file in some way, like using a beautifier. Or I want to\nproduce an output based on the file content, like getting totals or\nshowing lint errors.\nAgain, there are built in ways to do this, but a wrapper lets us do more\nwith our shell commands.\nReplacing Buffer Contents\nThis time, we don't need to pass any arguments to interactive.\nInstead, we use shell-command-on-region with the results of calling\npoint-min and point-max -- the start and end of the buffer,\nrespectively.\nalign-buffer aligns the entire buffer without the need to manually\nselect a region. This makes the it less error prone and easier to\nexecute. We can't select the region incorrectly, because we don't need\nto anymore. We only need to execute &lt;M-x&gt; align-buffer.\nDisplaying The Output of a Shell Command\nFor this examples, let's use eslint, a popular tool for linting\nJavaScript code.\neslint is different from our previous command. It takes a file name,\nnot the buffer contents. This means we will need to use some new\nfunctions.\nOnce again, we don't accept any arguments and pass nothing to\ninteractive. We get the buffer name by using the buffer-name\nfunction. Once we have the name, we merge it with the string eslint to\ncreate the final command, and pass it to shell-command. This logs the\noutput to a dedicate shell command buffer.\nNow we can execute run-eslint in any JavaScript file and see the\nresults of executing the command.\nSeeing the results is a good start. But eslint comes with a handy\n--fix flag that automatically fixes simple problems.\nTo add this flag you only need to change the string you pass to\nshell-command.\nWith that change, the simple issues get fixed automatically and we get a\nlog of the complex issues to fix manually.\nRunning Command Automatically\nFrom the last example we have a useful run-eslint function. But we\nneed to remember to run it every time we want to check a file. Let's\nreduce our mental burden, and let Emacs automatically execute this\nfunction every time we save a JavaScript file.\nThere are two facilities that makes automatic function execution precise\nand safe: modes and hooks.\nModes allow us to know what context we are in. When we open a new file,\na number of modes can activate. For our example, there is a built in\njs-mode that activates when we open a JavaScript file.\nWe will hook into the activation of this mode to limit the scope of our\nautomatic function execution to only JavaScript files. We wouldn't want\nto execute a command that changes file contents in an unsupported file\ntype.\nOnce we are inside js-mode, we will add another hook -- this time to\nan action. Since eslint can fix some issues for us, we will run it\nbefore the file is saved by hooking onto the before-save action.\nIn the implementation, we use add-hook to listen to the two action\ndescribed above. js-mode-hook only needs the function to execute when\nthe mode is activated. But before-save-hook needs the LOCAL option.\nThis only runs the action in the buffer it was activated in. Without\nthis flag, eslint would run on every file after we opened any\nJavaScript file.\nGoing Further\nI only scratched the surface of what's possible with Elisp. Projects\nlike magit provide amazing examples of extending\nbasic CLI tools.\nMagit is a wrapper around git. It doesn't change what git does.\nInstead, it adds on text manipulation and file awareness that Emacs is\ngood at. If you need inspiration for how to integrate other tools into\nEmacs, look no further.\nI hope that this article provided some inspiration and a few new tricks.\nHappy hacking.","id":"https://hackeryarn.com/post/cli-in-emacs/","title":"CLI commands in Emacs"},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/clojure-actions/":{"body":"I recently took over the maintenance of an open source Clojure project.\nOne of the first things I noticed was the lack CI or CD.

The CD portion helps with\ndeploying the project. And these parts become especially important if\nthe project is in maintenance mode.\nUnlike a project under active development where all the details are\nfresh in my mind and I am working on it almost daily, a project in\nmaintenance mode might not need any work for weeks or months. In that\ntime, I am likely to forget a step and cause things to get messy or\nworse, cause a regression. CI and CD provide a safety net against things\nslipping.\nSo with that reasoning in mind, I dove into CI/CD GitHub actions for\nClojure.\nGround work\nEvery GitHub action needs some setup to get the correct environment\nstarted.

All the\nsteps after this can proceed with Clojure fully setup.\nLint and test\nThe most basic, but probably most important action, is linting and\ntesting on every push or pull request. These are the steps that everyone\nshould run locally before making a push, but often forget.\nTo get both linting and tests running only required two short steps:\nTo get linting to work, I had to add\nlein-clj-kondo to the\nproject dependencies.\nThe testing portion didn't require any other setup besides following\nthe regular Clojure testing conventions.\nDeployment\nOnce you have linting and testing running, the next step is to make\ndeployment easier. The most reasonable way to automate this is to use\ntags. That way, when I create a new tag, it becomes automatically\navailable in Clojars.\nBesides providing the credentials as environment variables (see Using\nsecrets in GitHub\nActions\nfor how to make these available), I needed to do one more thing to make\nthis project deployable in an actions.\nBy default, Clojars requires signing of all releases.

If you've hear of or used Vagrant and thought it was a great idea but implemented in a really heavy handed manner, then Distrobox is exactly what you've been looking for.\nWithin a month Distrobox became my primary dev environment and that hasn't changed for over a year. In this post I hope to share how I use Distrobox and give you some tips for making the experience even better.\nWhat is Distrobox?\nDistrobox is a wrapper around Docker or Podman that give access to any Linux distro from any other Linux distro.\nPersonally, I prefer Podman. So the rest of the article will only mention Podman, but everything also applies to Docker.\nAt this point, you might be thinking \"But can't I already use Podman to run any Linux distro locally?\" Well yes you can, but Distrobox takes this a step further.\nThe shared environment\nThe main benefit of Distrobox, over just using Containers on their own, is the integration with the base system. A Distrobox container will have access to your home directory, devices, and a few other things which combine to make it feel like you are working natively.\nBut despite feeling like home, all the packages that you install remain safely i the container. The downside is that that you need to install all your dependencies in every environment. But, thanks to image layering, you can make this fairly efficient (more on this later).\nDon't containers already provide isolation?\nIf you've only recently started using Podman, you might think that having a project run in a Podman container is enough to provide isolation. If you've done this for a while, however, you've probably run into issues with tools that you need for development.\nLinters, debuggers, completion servers, even the languages themselves can all require project specific versions. This puts you right back at needing to manage multiple versions of packages and languages in your development environment. And there are tools that try to solve this, but each only works with a part of your stack, and most don't even try to address the issue of system packages (NixOS and Guix are notable exceptions).\nIn fact, I find this dev environment isolation so important that I spin up a new Distrobox container for every project.\nMaking per project containers efficient\nHaving a container for every project might sound wasteful and time consuming, but you can actually make it pretty quick and efficient. This efficiency is possible thanks to image layering done by Podman.\nI will not cover how layering works, but if you are curious, refer to the Docker documentation on layers.\nBecause underneath Distrobox just uses containers, you can easily create a base containers that has all the common tools for your dev environment. My base container looks something like this:\nYou might have noticed the last line in that file. That line avoids the whole problem of running containers in containers by allowing our dev environment to use the hosts Podman runtime. So you can continue to use Podman like normal while working inside a running container.\nThis all gets saved into a single layer and referenced by every projects specific environment. For example, my Django environment looks like this:\nThen I link everything together with a small script to build the containers in order:\nIf I need to run an update, I just execute the above script and I have a fresh set of containers.\nUsing graphical applications from Distrobox\nAnother critical features, if you use graphical applications (such as vscode) as part of your dev environmen, is running those applications natively.\nThe above setup might seem like it wouldn't work for for this. After all, wouldn't it take a bunch of configurations to get a graphical application from a container to display and work on the host? In most cases, it would, but Distrobox takes care of all this.\nTo start up vscode, you can just run code inside your Distrobox terminal and everything work. You will be actually running a graphical tool from inside your container without any extra steps. Better yet, as far as that instance of vscode is concerned, it's running in the environment of the container and uses all the packages available there.\nThis is a great start. But Distrobox takes it even further. If going through a terminal seems like an extra burden, you can run distrobox-export --app code to make the .desktop file available on your base system (with the distrobox name prefixed). Then you don't even have to open a terminal and can get your whole environment, including the app, running right from your desktop.\nIt's really amazing for just how many things this process works. I even have a container that runs QEMU VMs.\nDistrobox makes an immutable OS practical\nI won't go on soap box about immutable OSes for too long. You can read about why I use one here. But I will say that they keep your system more secure, more stable, and easier to maintain. The two biggest ones out there are Fedora Silverblue and OpenSUSE MicroOS.\nWithout Distrobox, it really doesn't makes sense to use one of these systems for development. Luckily Distrobox makes it easy to experiment and work in a container, while never breaking the base system.\nConclusion\nDistrobox can do many more interesting things, but having a set of per-project containers is the biggest thing that took Distrobox from a neat tool to something practical that I use every day across multiple systems.\nI hope this gives you some ideas of how you can improve your dev setup with Distrobox.","id":"https://hackeryarn.com/post/distrobox/","title":"Distrobox in practice"},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/django-returns-1/":{"body":"Django is a great framework for web development. Unfortunately, due to\nthe nature of Python and web development in general, it often leads to\nhard to track down bugs and tangled code. We will take a look at one way\nto reign this in.\nThroughout this series we will follow the official Django\ntutorial while\nmaking the code safer and easier to reason about. We will accomplish\nthis by enlist the help of mypy (for general\ntype checking) and returns (for\ncontainers that will provide safety).\nI will not cover the basics of Django or Python. If you ever feel like\nyou don't fully understand the Django portion, you can refer to the\nofficial tutorial. The parts of this tutorial will directly correspond\nto the parts of the official tutorial.\nI will explain how we're integrating returns and the benefits of\njumping through some of the extra hoops that it requires. I will not\ncover the underlying theory behind returns. For that, you can read their\nexcellent documentation.\nWhat makes code safe?\nThere are two properties that make a piece of code safe. It has to be\npure and complete.\nAs an example, 2 + 2 is a pure and complete piece of code. Every time\nwe run this code, we will always get back 4. If we wanted to, we could\neven replace this code with 4 itself. This is easy to reason about,\neasy to understand, and easy to test. These properties make a piece of\ncode pure and complete.\nThings get complicated, however, once we introduce functions calls. If\nwe have get_two() + get_two(), some questions immediately start to\narise: What kind of thing does get_two() return? Does get_two()\nalways return the same thing? Can get_two() fail?\nWe can, of course, read the source code to answer these questions. This\ngives us full understanding of what the abstraction does, but it quickly\nbecomes time consuming and after going a few layers deep it becomes hard\nto keep everything in our heads. The other option is to blindly trust\nthat the name of the function fully states what it does. This options\nlets us proceed with using the abstraction, but it could easily get us\ninto trouble -- see the questions above. So what's the solution?\nLet us address these problems one at a time.\nWhat kind of thing does get_two() return?\nAs the code stands, we have not way know that get_two() returns a 2,\na \"2.0\", a 100, 200, or any other crazy thing.\nmypy can help here:\nThis one additions lets us know, right away, that we will get an int.\nNo accidental strings or tuple can sneak into our code.\nDoes get_two() always return the same thing?\nThis question becomes harder to answer and reason about. This function\ncould return 2 on the first call, but on the second call returns\nsomething totally different. This will often happen if a function gets\nthe value from a database, calculates the value based on time, or grabs\na random number. If it does any of these things, we have no way of\nknowing without reading the body.\nLet's assume that in this case, we are doing one of the impure\nthings mentioned above. So what can we do about it? Well, we can mark\nthe value as impure by using a special container called IO.\nThis container tell all the caller that the function does something more\nthan simply calculate a value. It also requires that any function that\nuses this return value also returns an IO container. This is a good\nthing. It lets us know, without reading the source, that we can't\ndepend on the result always being the same. Although, it should still\nmake us want to read the source to figure out what impure thing a\nfunction called get_two() could be doing.\nCan get_two() fail?\nThe final question is especially troubling in Python. Python a lot of\npython code can throw exceptions without warning. Even simple things\nlike dividing by zero could throw an exception that crashes our\napplications -- if not handled properly.\nWe could wrap everything in a giant try statement, but wouldn't it be\nnice to know ahead of time that this function could result in an\nexception?\nThrowing an error makes a function incomplete because it cannot\nalways return the promised value. Just like with IO we can use the\ntype system to let all the callers know this. The new container we will\nuse is Result.\nThis container lets the callers know that we could expect an int or\nand Exception. Better yet, it forces the caller to also return a\nResult container or to handle the exception.\nStarting the project\nUse your favorite method to install Django, and let's dive in right\nwhere part the official\ntutorial\nstarts.\nWe will start the project just like a typical Django project:\nNext we need to install some dependencies that will allow us to use the\ntype system to its fullest:\nmypy provides our type system and integrates well with the rest of\nour dependencies.\ndjango-stubs provides type stubs for Django.\nreturns provides type safe functional programming facilities.\nOnce we have the dependencies installed, we need to configure returns\nand Django to work smoothly with mypy.\nsetup.cfg:\nPolls app\nWe will follow the django tutorial and create the Polls app:\nThe index view function will look almost the same, except we will add\nsome types.\npolls/view.py:\nGiving the request a type might seem excessive right now, but when we\npass it to a function later on, this will make sure that we pass the\nright thing.\nBefore we can access our new view, we need to update a couple urls.py\nfiles:\npolls/urls.py:\ndjango_returns/urls.py:\nAfter these steps, we can access the site at\nhttp://localhost:8000/polls/ after running:\nWrap up\nWe covered the goal of this tutorial series along with some basic\nterminology that we will use throughout.

Since __str__ is a magic method, it will\nrequire a little extra work and build on what we will learn when we\nwrite was_published_recently.\npolls/models.py:\nFirst off, note that when we write methods, we do not add a type to\nself. We do, however, add a return type to all methods. This one lets\nus know that we will get back a boolean value.\nWe also added the impure_safe decorator. As the name implies, this\ndecorator helps us mark functions that are impure and unsafe.\nwas_published_recently is impure because it reaches out to the\ndatabase, where we can't guarantee what we get back, and relies on\ntime, which constantly changes.\nwas_published_recently is also unsafe because of the dependency on the\ndatabase. All kinds of things can go wrong when we try to get a value\nout of a database: the database could be down, the table might not\nexist, the model fields could have changed, we forgot to run our\nmigrations, etc.\nimpure_safe doesn't fix these issues, but it lets the caller know\nthat this is no longer a simple function that returns a bool.\nIf we try to call this functions, we will see that impure_safe changed\nour bool return type to IOResultE[bool, Exception]. This wrapper\nputs two layers around the bool value. The first layer, Result,\nprevents us from getting the value without first checking and handling\nthe Exception. The second layer, IO, prevents us from using the\nvalue outside of other IO functions (we don't want to mix pure and\nimpure code).\nNext, we will start our implementation __str__. As mentioned earlier,\nmagic methods are a little tricky to handle. It would be nice if we\ncould just annotate __str__ with impure_safe, but python won't know\nhow to handle our IOResultE wrapper. So we have to come to a\ncompromise.\npolls/models.py:\nWe create a safe_str function with the impure_safe decorator. When\nwe need to get a string representation in our code, we should default to\nusing this function since it has all of our safety improvements.\nsafe_str helps our code, but we will still need a proper __str__\nimplementation so we can get nice output at our shell.\nSince this functionality is mainly for the shell, this is a good time to\nfire up a shell session. If we run safe_str or\nwas_published_recentrly, we will notice that the return value is\n&lt;IOResult: &lt;Success: ...&gt;&gt; this is the printable representation of the\ntwo wrappers.\nWe can take off the Result wrapper by running\nvalue_or(\"error message\"). This gives us back a &lt;IO: ...&gt; value.\nUnlike Result which we can unwrap and inspect in a safe manner (as\nlong as we handle any failures), IO is always unsafe. In order to\nremove the IO wrapper we need to run the ominously named\nunsafe_perform_io.\nWe should be very careful with unsafe_perform_io. Running\nunsafe_perform_io removes all the safety that we worked so hard\nbuilding up. But because python is, by its nature, unsafe we will need\nto use it. In order to keep as much safety as possible, however, we must\nlimit its usage to the places where we need to hand off the value to\npython, Django, or any library outside our control. The __str__ magic\nmethod is exactly this kind of place, so it's ok to use\nunsafe_perform_io there.\nThe use of unsafe_perform_io on the edges of our application is the\nbasis of a common design patter known as imperative shell and functional\ncore. returns automatically pushes us towards this pattern, and we\nwill see how to further utilize it in the next part.\nNow that we know how to remove the our wrappers, we can implement\n__str__ in the safest possible manner.\npolls/models.py:\nWrap up\nThis part of the Django tutorial introduced the simplest way to work\nwith returns. The benefits seem marginal, if any for now, but the real\npower of returns and this type safe approach comes throw when we need\nto compose multiple functions with different wrappers and properties.\nThat will be the focus of the next part of this tutorial.\nIn the meantime, I encourage you to go through at least all the shell\nexamples in the official\ntutorial and\nexplore how our changes made these functions work differently than what\nyou see in the tutorial.","id":"https://hackeryarn.com/post/django-returns-2/","title":"Type safe Django app, Part 2"},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/django-returns-3/":{"body":"In Part 2 we got a taste of\nusing returns and created our first model methods.\nIn this part, we will build out views that interact with databases and learn how to combine returns containers. This composition is the key to effectively using container types and where we will see the benefits of all our work.\nWrit views that actually do something\nThe first view introduced in the official tutorial performs multiple actions which we will split up into individual functions. Writing individual functions will help us give names to the actions that we take, bring the types to the forefront, and clearly demonstrate how to compose small functions.\nFirst off the view needs to get the last 5 questions:\nAs we’ve seen before, this operation is impure and unsafe because it reaches out to the database.\nThe next action extracts the text from each question.\nSurprisingly, this simple function is also impure and unsafe. We need to mark it as unsafe because it will take a QuerySet and execute a lookup on it for question_text. When the lookup gets executed, Django will hit the database, unless we have retrieved the data before. Since, we have no way to know if we have the data already, it’s safer to mark it as impure and unsafe.\nLastly, we create a display string from the list of strings retrieved by _question_text:\nThis function is pure, safe, and straight forward.\nWith the individual pieces working, we can combine them:\nThat’s a lot of new functions. Let’s break them down one by one.\nflow composes any number single argument functions. The first argument must have the same type as the argument of the next function, which must return the same type as the argument of the function following it, and so on.\nThis process helps clearly show a pipeline of the transformations our data goes through. If we need to add or remove a step, we only modify one line and we’re done.\nbind is a little trickier. If we carefully inspect the types of the functions that we’re trying to use in flow, we will notice that something doesn’t quite line up with our earlier observation o how flow works. _latest_question_list returns a IOResultE[QuerySet[Question]] but _questions_text expects QuerySet[Question]; the types don’t match.\nbind handles this exact scenario. When applied to IOResultE, it will check the output. If the result is a Success, bind will unwrap IOResultE and pass it’s contents to _questions_text. If the Result is a Failure, bind will skip calling questions_text and move on to the next step in the pipeline.\nmap_ performs the same steps as bind. It unwraps IOResultE and passes the value to _list_to_string, but instead of returning the value that _list_to_string returns, it wraps the value from _list_to_string in the IOResultE container (or Success to be more exact.)\nbind and _map are closely related. Some languages/libraries even call bind flat_map. It’s often called flat_map because it does the same thing as _map but removes one of the layers.\nIf we ran _map(_questions_text) instead of bind(_questions_text), we would ended up with a return value of IOResultE[IOResultE[...]]. This happens because both _last_question_list and _questions_text return a value wrapped in a IOResultE. Since this type communicates success or failure, we don’t need to know or care about how many times it had to succeed. We only care that all the action succeeded, which a single Success can communicate as well as 2 Success wrappers.\nWe can follow a general rule on when to use bind vs. _map. If both functions work inside the same context (return the same container type), use bind. If the functions work in a different context, and the latter function is pure and safe, use _map.\nTo wrap up the view function, we unwrap the value and return it as an HttpResponse.\nThis process required learning a lot of new concepts, but we will use them again and again. Soon enough, they will become second nature.\nUsing a template\nUsing a template introduces a new challenge. We can no longer use flow since\ntemplate.render requires two arguments.\nLet's see how we can make this work without unwrapping twice.\nFirst we create a small wrapper around loader.get_template:\nThis simply ensure that we get back the correct type. Since loading a template\nrequire IO, we need to mark it as impure_safe.\nThis gives us all the pieces that we need to create the template:\nFirst we get the two arguments we need to pass to template.render. Both of these values are wrapped in an IOResultE. Luckily, all the wrapper types also have methods corresponding to the helper functions we’ve used in flow.\nWe can get the raw value by calling bind on the template and inside it calling map on the context. Then we just pass both the values to template.render.\nWe have to call bind because the inner map application will return an IOResultE and we don’t want to end up with a double wrapper type. If we had to unwrap more layers, we would call bind on all the layers except the last.\nThat was a pretty complex process just to call a function with two arguments. Usually, having to jump through this many hoops indicates that we could use a better abstractions. In this case, Django has us covered.\nA shortcut: render()\nThat looks much simpler. It’s a straight forward flow pipeline that we can easily follow. We can also start using lambdas instead of explicit helper functions as we become more comfortable with abstractions.\nThis example provides a more realistic example of how using returns looks likes.\nRaising a 404 error\nWe have to deviate slightly from the official tutorial here. get_object_or_404 doesn’t buy us anything, so we will avoid using it. Instead, we will extend the example a bit and handle both 404 and 500 errors depending on the type of failure that we get:\nThe flow pipeline remains the same, we only add a new case statement to handle the final output. If you’ve never seen case statements in python, that’s to be expected.\nPythons 3.10 introduces case statements. These are prefect for our use case. We can match the IOResultE type for either Failure or Success. We can event further destructure the Failure to inspect the type of error, and Success to access the IO action directly.\nOne thing to remember here, is that no matter where we get an error inside flow, it will stop further computations and return that Failure. This gives us the ability only worry about the happy path inside flow and offload all the error handling to a single place.\nWrap up\nWith that, we covered all the major pieces needed to effectively use returns with Django.\nreturns provides quite a few more tools, but they require more complex scenarios and only provide slight variants of what we covered in this series.\nThe rest of the Django tutorial focuses on Django specific details and we won’t get to see anything new. Therefore, this is where I will stop the series. But I encourage you to continue with the tutorial on your own and try to use what you learned here.","id":"https://hackeryarn.com/post/django-returns-3/","title":"Type safe Django app, Part 3"},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/dry/":{"body":"DRY has become a mantra throughout the industry. Any time repetitive code shows up, DRY gets applied as a cure all. If you even start to question DRYing up a piece of code, you are viewed as a heretic to the entire industry.\nOk, maybe it's not that bad, but many times DRY gets applied without much thought. This careless application of DRY leads to brittle code, making even simple changes scary because they could have a huge ripple effect.\nIn this article I hope to show how this happens and cover different ways to look for abstractions. I will even make an argument that duplication is good in the right setting.\nAn example\nFirst off, to keep things simple, we are just going to work with functions. I am not going to cover how these concepts work when using classes, typeclasses, traits, or interfaces. I know how tempting it will be to use a cleaner form of abstraction, but doing that would lead us down a whole new set of rabbit holes.\nOur example will consist of an application to calculate salaries of employees at different levels. We start out with two types of employees, and right away we notice repetition creeping up:\nNow, would you want to extract this code into its own function? I know I would. And is the repetition a good enough reason for the extraction?\nI think that this is absolutely the right case for extraction, but not because of the repetition. There is a more subtle reason why we should extract this code, which we will get to later.\nFor now, let's proceed with extracting the repetitive code:\nWhen we extract this code, we create a clean separation of concerns. We have a single place that deals with bonus calculations and functions that use the bonus calculation when calculating the employee's compensation.\nEverything looks great so far.\nHow problems arise\nAs our code lives for a few weeks or months, it grows. And more functions start using calculate_bonus. Calculations for directors and VPs also started using this same function. This company is all about equality, so everyone has the same bonus structure.\nBut we just got a requirement to handle C-Level employee's compensations, and their bonus structure is a little different. For every year that they were with the company, they get an additional $2,000 bonus.\nHow would you handle this situation?\nWe have two reasonable options. We can add this logic into the new calculate_clevel_compensation, or we can expand calculate_bonus.\nAdding this logic into calculate_clevel_compensation doesn't quite feel right. We already isolated the concept of bonus calculation into its own function. Putting the calculation here would just spread our bonus calculation logic across multiple functions.\nThat leaves us with keeping all the bonus calculating logic together. Here is how we might expand calculate_bonus to handle the new requirement:\nOn the surface this looks like a good solution. By providing a default value for clevel we avoid having to update the old function invocations, and our new function just has to provide one flag.\nNow, what would happen if another position gets a different bonus structure? We could just add another flag, add another if, and make sure all the right places use the right flags.\nAnd what if there is some shared logic between two of those flags? Or what if multiple flags need to interact with each other in some special way? You can see how this innocent function can quickly get out of hand.\nThese problem arise because this solution has two serious problems.\nFirst off, it introduces a new option named clevel which has nothing to do with the concept of a bonus calculation. It's related to the role which should be fully encapsulated by the function calling calculate_bonus.\nThis bleeding over of concepts makes code significantly harder to follow. Because clevel tells us nothing about how it might impact the bonus calculation, we have to read two functions and keep track of the related parts in our minds. And if we have more of these \"helper\" functions, we end up having to keep a lot of information in our head just to understand the flow of a single calculation.\nThe other problem is closely related to the first, but more insidious. Having the level as part of the bonus calculation tightly couples this function to the concept of levels. We lose all ability to apply this function in different contexts.\nIf we want to run a simulation that shows the impacts of different bonus structures we currently have to introduce levels into it, but levels should not be taken into consideration when simulating bonus structures. This kills DRY's promise of re-usability.\nThese are some serious issues, but not all is lost. Let's look at a way that we can identify and fix these problems.\nAbstraction Barriers\nA better approach to breaking up functions comes form a concept significantly older than DRY. Abstraction barriers were first formally introduced in Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, published in 1984.\nI encourage you to read the section linked above if you're not afraid of too many parentheses. But for the purpose of this article I can sum up this concept as: build abstractions in well defined layers.\nWithout reading the linked section, you might wonder what constitutes a layer. The most basic layer that every program has is the language itself. All the built-in functions and operators create an abstraction layer over the machine code that executes the program. We would almost never want to go below the level of our language, so it is the bottom of our layers stack.\nThe next most common layer is made up of the libraries that we import. They provide further abstraction over the language and allow working in terms of the library's domain.\nThe layers that we build should work in a similar manner to libraries. Each one providing a clear and encapsulated domain.\nWhen we started our program, we were working in a layer that dealt with employees and their levels. By extracting our function, we unintentionally introduced a new layer. Because we didn’t put much thought into the extraction past DRYing up the code, the layer looked like it only dealt with calculating bonuses but that is too narrow. If we take a closer look, we can see that we started on a layer for financial calculations.\nIf you prefer to think of it in terms of domains: The first layer belongs to the HR domain. It deals with employees and what their levels entail.\nThe second layer belongs to the accounting domain: It deals with the details that go into calculating certain financial concepts – bonuses being one of them.\nIf we need clarification on terminology or functionality, this distinction points us towards the right group to talk to. It also keeps our code closely aligned with how the real world works –&nbsp;something our programs should emulate.\nApplying Abstraction Barriers\nAfter identifying these layers, it becomes easy to see that our terminology doesn't quite match. calculate_bonus should use terminology that only relates to the financial domain. Levels don’t belong here.\nLet's fix our terminology now:\nWe did two things here. We renamed the variable to yearly_increase, which relates to the calculation in any context. And we switched from passing a boolean to passing a number.\nUsing a boolean was permissible when the layers were intertwined. Once we separated them, however, we can clearly see that the bonus amount is tied to the level. This refactor flows naturally when we start thinking of these concepts independently.\nSome of you might have seen this from the beginning. As people progress in their careers, they tend to develop a \"smell\" for these types of abstractions. Some even say that you can only develop these skills through enough experience. But I believe that thinking in abstraction barriers provides a shortcut seeing the right abstractions.\nEven if you already developed this 6th sense for good abstraction, having abstraction barriers in your toolbox can help you spot these refactors in a more disciplined way.\nTaking it further\nWe covered the basics of abstraction barriers, but there are a few more guiding principles that pair nicely with abstraction barriers to make them even more powerful.\nSeeing your code as a tree\nEach layer we create builds on top of the one before it. And each layer consists of multiple modules at the same relative level of abstraction. This creates a tree like relationship between the modules.\nTo make things easy to follow and understand, just like with trees in code, layers should only talk to the layers below them. Ideally, each layer should also follow The Law of Demeter and only communicate to the layer immediately below itself. But most of the time simply keeping the communication unidirectional is good enough.\nIf we stray from this rule and allow a middle layer to talk to any layer, we suddenly find ourselves in a hard to follow mess. To make things worse, we might even introduce circular dependencies that prevent higher layers from even importing some lower layers.\nSo any time that we see a need for a layer to use one above or adjacent to it, we should ask ourselves if we are missing a layer further up the stack which can compose the necessary functionality.\nBuilding complete layers\nIn the original example, we left comments for more calculation that happened before and after the duplicate code. The fact that they are called calculations should flag that they are happening in the wrong layer.\nWe might already have helpers for some of these. In that case, we should review these helper functions for any bleed over of details. If we find concepts like the clevel for the bonus calculation, we should move them to the correct layers.\nOther parts, however, might be implemented inline with the rest of the level logic. We should carefully review these and make the relevant parts stand alone calculations. Yes, even if we don't see them being reused, we should still move them to the calculations layer.\nLet's look at what a final function might look like before we talk about the advantages of having everything related to calculations in its own layer.\nWhen building functions this way, we simplify the work of our higher level functions. This function no longer needs to worry about any complex logic. It only needs to know which calculations to call and how to combine them.\nSimplifying this function means that we greatly reduce the possibility of mistakes , and ease future modifications. Whether we need to add, remove, or re-order the calculations, we can quickly identify where to make the change and confidently apply it without worrying about breaking something else.\nPrefer small functions\nThe above solution is much clearer, but it's still not perfect. Any time a function takes an optional argument, it should raise a red flag.\nThis might be controversial since many standard libraries have functions with tons of optional arguments. Python's print, as an example, takes 4 optional arguments just to output some text. But I would argue that having multiple functions for each of the scenarios that require flags would make things much clearer.\nLet's first look at our example and see if we can spot the issue. calculate_bonus is the only function that takes multiple arguments and one of them is optional. It's calculating the standard bonus and a yearly bonus. If you have to use an and while describing the purpose a function, it mean that it's doing too much.\nThe solution, as you might expect, is to introduce another function. With which our final version of calculate_clevel_compnsation will look like this:\nThis version makes it even easier to see all the steps. We can now clearly see that there is no interaction between the two functions, and we could even add another step in-between them without going into a different function.\nLet's bring a little more focus to the point just mentioned because it is the biggest source of issues with optional arguments. If a function takes multiple optional arguments, it hides how their interactions with each other.\nIf we go back to our original version, with multiple arguments, and add another argument to set a maximum bonus, it addition raises all kinds of questions: Do we cap the bonus amount before or after the yearly increase? Should we change the maximum bonus amount if a yearly increase is present? etc. And we can't answer these questions without looking into calculate_bonus. That puts us back at keeping track of multiple functions just to understand how a single function works.\nIf we keep our functions small, on the other hand, we can easily see where a cap_bonus function gets applied. And we can understand the interaction without the need to dive into another function.\nRepetition has to go somewhere\nI mentioned before that if you have to use an and to describe what a function does, than it is doing too much. If we stuck to this axiom everywhere, our programs wouldn't do a whole lot. We have to combine all our functions somewhere. But because repetition complicates our programs, we should strive to minimize where we use it.\nThe right place for repetition is at the top most layer of our program. In our case, that's the calculate_x_compoenstion functions. If you look back, you might feel a strong urge to DRY these up. After all, their bodies will look mostly the same. But you must resist this urge.\nIf we continue to view the program as a tree, having a single place of control keeps the tree flat. The flatter we keep the tree, the less likely it is that modifications to lower layer will have a ripple effect throughout the higher levels.\nHave you ever upgraded a base library to a new major version? Or worse, upgraded your language? It's a huge pain that haunts you for the rest of your career. Keeping your code flat makes sure that you don't create the same pain in your code base.\nRepetition at the top layer also has a use. It provides flexibility. By having the full operation outlined in one place, even if it's very similar to other implementations, leaves it open for modification. This is important as we get closer to the actual business domain.\nWhile some low level concepts are as solid as our universe (I don't expect how we calculate averages to change any time soon). Our business domain changes all the time. If we aren't flexible in adopting to these needs, then any change to our program becomes a huge ordeal.\nIn order to keep this flexibility, we also need to stay mindful of which parts change the most often. If we start noticing a lower layer changing frequently, we need to look at ways to move the parts that changes closer to the top of the layer stack. Doing this will ensure that we can continue to respond to changing requirements quickly.\nSo to thumb up the high level direction of the codebase: the lowest layers should have functions so fundamental that they almost never change and require the absolute minimum amount of dependencies. The highest layers, on the other hand, should have functions that clearly and fully outline how lower layers get combined, while having very little custom logic. In-between these two extremes, we should have a spectrum of layers that tries to stay closer to the lowest layers and leave most of the gluing to the top layers.\nIn conclusion\nThe next time you see a concept repeating, try to go beyond just extracting common functionality. Take the time to put it into the appropriate layer, make it smaller, and make sure that any related concepts get extracted with it. That way every change you make will make your code base easier to maintain instead of harder.","id":"https://hackeryarn.com/post/dry/","title":"When DRY goes wrong"},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/embrace-the-constraints/":{"body":"Engineers want to measure the quality and effectiveness of their work.\nThey turn to code coverage, burn down charts, and yearly goals, with the\nbest intention.\nThese measurements provide quantitative data about how much planned work\nwas delivered, but they fail to tie the work to outcome. What good are\n1,000 lines of code if the users never use the feature? These metrics\ndistract from the two question every professional should ask:\nDid my work deliver measurable change?\nDid I stay within the constraints?\nEveryone is familiar with the concept of measurable results. Others have\nwritten and talked extensively on how to measure the right thing:\nProduct Development Cycle\nFundamentals\nHow to Measure\nValue\nMeasuring\nEffectiveness\nWhat's the Story About Agile\nData\nBut the second question, around constraints, may come as a surprise. As\nengineers we have an aversion to constraints. We think they limit the\nquality of the solutions we deliver.\nIn reality, it's not the engineer that finds the best new tool that's\nhighly regarded, it's the one that gets the results with what's right\nin front of him. The developer that mastered his domain brings more\nvalue.\nAs we dive down the rabbit hole of new tools in search of perfection:\ntimelines double, bugs get introduced, and the whole project comes to a\nscreeching halt because of the mountain of tech debt.\nThe expert engineer, on the other hand, is careful about introducing new\ntools. She doesn't pull in a library for left pad because she knows how\nto write that code. Her scope for new bugs is small so when she\nintroduces one she quickly finds it, in her own code.\nOK, most of the time the search for new tools doesn't get that bad, and\nthe expert engineer is a myth. But the price of looking for a way around\nthe constraints is very real, and we should strive to be more like the\nexpert engineer.\nIn this article I want to cover the most common constraints I come\nagainst and provide the techniques I found to dealing with them.\nNot Enough Time\nWhether a bug came up, an outage happened, or we just underestimated the\nwork, we constantly come up against time constraints. It's the nature\nof a job in a highly complex domain.\nThe easy solution is pushing back the feature. We can finish it at the\nbeginning of next sprint because we work in small increments... Right?\nIn my experience, time constraints rarely become an issue if the tasks\nare kept small. As long as the tasks are kept small, features get\ndelivered every iteration and no one gets upset because the application\nprogresses forward.\nTime constraints become an issue when we take on too much work at once.\nWhen the timeline is up and we have nothing to show. We might be one bug\naway from delivering the features, but that doesn't matter if the stake\nholders get nothing.\nTo prevent this situation, you have to break the all or nothing\nmentality. When you realize the task you're working on is too much;\nstop. Reevaluate the requirement.\nGo back to the stakeholders with the goal of figuring out smaller chunks\nhidden in the details. Pareto principle states that 20% of the work\nholds 80% of the value. When features bloat, it's up to you to figure\nout the 20% that will deliver 80% of the value. You can revisit the rest\nlater, if needed.\nMissing or Changing Requirements\nBefore you can be effective you need to have clarity of the\nexpectations. To get clarity you need to ask questions.\nYour question will result in one of three outcomes:\nIf the feature is high priority, you will get to have the needed\nconversation and gain clarity. This will let you start work with a\nbetter idea of what's expected and minimum down time.\nA much worse outcome, but all too possible, is that you can't get\nanyone to look at the feature. When this happens you should question the\npriorities. If it's not a high enough priority to define well, it's\nnot high enough priority to work on. The work is endless, your time\nisn't. See what else is needed and select a task you can accomplish.\nThe third option, and the one you stand to gain the most from, is that\nthe feature is high priority but the users aren't sure what they want.\nWhen this happens, you get the chance to create low fidelity prototypes,\nexplore new approaches, and get into a creative mindset. Working through\nthis process with users allows you to learn about them which result in\nbetter understanding on all future work. The return on the time you\ninvestment is enormous.\nUnrealistic Expectations\nIf your stake holders are non-technical, like they often are, you will\ninevitably come up against ridiculous expectations. \"It will only take\na couple hours to add authorization, right?\" These expectation may even\nbe your own doing. If your application is well build and easy to use, it\nbecomes indistinguishable from magic. Everything seems easy from the\noutside.\nBut don't get frustrated by these requests. They provide another chance\nto connect with the stake holders. This time, allow them to understand\nmore about your work. Compare and contrast features and explain why this\nfeature might take longer than another.\nOnce the stake holders know the work required, they will give you more\ntime or pick a feature they can have sooner. The important part is, to\neducated the stake holders so next time they know the scope of a similar\nfeature.\nThe Right Tool for the Job\nThe notion of \"the right tool for the job\" echoes through every\noffice. Unfortunately, it's misunderstood almost as often as it's\nuttered.\nRight doesn't mean perfect. It means the tool that enables you to\naccomplish the job without wasting time. It even changes depending on\nthe person or team.\nIf a team knows nothing about a language used to implement the perfect\ntool, they could spend weeks learning enough to implement the solution.\nSure future work may get easier, but will the amount of future work\njustify the investment?\nOn the other hand, if they use the language they know and add library\nthat gets them 80% of the way, they can give the users results now. Then\nyou can come back to evaluate that perfect tool with a better knowledge\nof the alternative.\nNo matter which option you pick, remember that every new dependency\nneeds careful consideration. Your team has to learn the tool. You have\nto make sure the tool is maintained, or has clean code so you could take\non the maintenance. You have to verify that it works with the rest of\nyour dependencies. If this sounds like too much work, consider\nimplementing the features you need yourself.\nTechnological Limitations\nThis is the most surprising area of frustration. Many of us have gone to\nschool, or spent vast amount of time, to learn about optimizations, data\nstructures, and algorithms. We learned about these so we could deal with\ntechnological limitation.\nWhen you come up against this limitation -- like processing speed,\nmemory limits, rendering speed -- it's not time to dispaire. It's time\nto celebrate. You finally get to dust off that old book and figure out a\ntough problem.\nThe important part, for those around you is that you set realistic\nexpectations. There won't be a quick solution. It will take a\nsignificant time investment.\nOnce the expectations are set and you get to start the work, consider\nyourself lucky. These challenges don't come along often. So dive in and\nenjoy the learning.\nWrap Up\nThis isn't an exhaustive list of constraints. These are just the once I\nfight with most often. Still, I hope it serves as a reminder, to you and\nme, about how lucky we are to work in a field that allows us to solve\nproblems every day. To enjoy the process, we just have to expand our\nscope of what problems we are solving.\nFinally, I would like to thank Seth Godin for the\ninspiration\nfor this article.","id":"https://hackeryarn.com/post/embrace-the-constraints/","title":"Embrace your constraints"},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/hierarchies-in-hakyll/":{"body":"Creating hierarchy in a blog is a useful technique. It allows you to\nhave different sections by type of content. It lets users navigate by\ntheir interests quickly. It makes your blog organized.\nMy need for a hierarchy came when working on another blog - Daily\nReading Notes. That blog involves notes\non books I read daily. Since each book has multiple reading notes, I\nwanted to allow two forms of navigation: by a grouping of all notes for\na particular book and by posted date. The groupings also needed to be\ndynamic. I didn't want to write code or updated configurations every\ntime I added a new book.\nHakyll didn't support this out of the\nbox, and I didn't find examples of anyone using similar layouts. So, I\ncreated my own approach which I am now sharing.\nStructuring the posts directory\nIn order to build a dynamic hierarchy, the directory structures needs to\nsupport association of the books with their related posts.\nWe start our implementation by creating a page and a folder with the\nname of the book inside the posts directory. This naming convention\nallows us to link the book's page to the folder containing the posts.\nOur directory structure should have the following layout:\nMatching the Routes\nWith the directory structure in place, we can proceed to creating\nmatchers for the books and posts pages.\nFor the books pages, we match all the files in the posts directory\nwhile ignoring directories and their contents. We also set the extension\nof these file to html. The extension need to be specified because the\noriginal files are written in markdown.\nFor the posts pages, we use posts/*/* as the matcher string. The first\n* tells match to look inside any directory within posts. The\nsecond * tells match to gets all the files inside the subdirectory.\nThese file are also written in markdown and need their extension set to\nhtml.\nThe matchers with extensions look like this:\nGetting the Posts for a Book\nNow that we are matching the books and posts pages, we need to group the\nposts by their respective book. For this purpose, we write a small\nhelper function that takes the output of\nHakyll's getResourceFilePath\nfunction.\nOur function takes the file path for the book page, strips out\neverything but the file name, and add a glob pattern to the end.\nWe use this function in the books pages matcher to get a list of the\nbook's posts as an input for the newly created bookCtx.\nCreating the bookCtx goes in the compile block:\nThis compile block is similar to the auto generated example that lists\nall the posts. Except, we generate the path for the posts relatively to\nthe current file.\nApplying Templates\nIn the final step, we apply templates to both outputs. The book pages\nneed a new template that uses the posts list context field we\ngenerated in the previous step. The posts can continue using the default\npost template. In addition to the individual templates, both the\nmatchers will need the default template and the relativizeUrls helper.\nThe final output of the two matchers looks like this:\nWrapping up\nWith these matchers in place, we have a hierarchy of books containing\nthe posts related to them. We can add books by creating a new page and\nfolder with the name of the book. This setup made it easy for me to\nmaintain a hierarchical site. I hope it does the same for you.\nThe final result of a book page looks like this: The Lean Startup book\npage.

So I started searching for an equivalent in lisp. I quickly came across quicklisp. To my surprise, however, quicklisp worked differently than these packages. It works more like a dependency cache than true dependency manager, but that is a topic for another article.\nThe biggest struggle that quicklisp brought was managing local packages. quicklisp had no way to reference a dependency at a certain path, and couldn't automatically import the project I was in. This is all for good reason since ASDF (the common lisp build system) allows a lot of freedom.\nI went looking for a better way to manage my local projects. I wanted a way to load local projects in a similar way to external dependencies while keeping things organized.\nIt turns out that quicklisp will check multiple locations for local project before it tries to pull down a dependency. This means that as long as all local projects exist in one of these locations, they get treated no differently than external dependencies.\nOne location that particularly appealed to me was the \\~/common-lisp folder. This became where I store actual applications or scripts that will never become quicklisp libraries.\nIf I want to modify a library or start my own, on the other hand, I prefer to use one of the directories in ql:*local-project-directories*. This variable holds a list of directories for local projects, and can be expanded in any way needed. I, however, stick with the default \\~/.quicklisp/local-projects/\".\nKeeping my projects split up in this manner allows for easy separation of concerns. When I work on a library, I can take the extra care needed to make sure I document things and keep the public api slim.\nWhen I start working on an application, especially a personal tool, these become less of a concern and I can just focus on getting it working.\nThis simple scheme has helped me keep things organized while loading everything in the same manner with ql:quickload.","id":"https://hackeryarn.com/post/local-common-lisp-projects/","title":"Managing local common lisp projects"},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/lodash/":{"body":"I really loved lodash. It brough the joy of compact functional code to\nJavaScript. Especially 6 years ago when I first embraced it. It was a wonderful library.\nBack then, there was no ES6, no Babel, and terrible browser incompatabilities\nran rampant. Lodash along with jQuery were the saving light of that time.\nI gravitated towards using Lodash because the first language I learned was\nScheme. It had functional programing at it's core, and highly influanced how I\nthink about code to this day.\nI was a major advocate of Lodash for a long time. However, as my team\nembraced ES6 with Babel, I am at a point where I have to\ndiscurage the use of Lodash instead of promote it. This might seem like a\ndrastic change but it is a well grounded one. It's also not just ES6 and Babel\nthat are taking my attention away from Lodash. There are libraries like Ramda that provide the better functionality(but more on that later).\nES6 vs Lodash\nI will outline some of the benefits I saw in using pure ES6 instead of Lodash.\nThe main stumbling point in this transition can be browser support but most teams use\ntranspilers such as Babel, so this isn't a concern anymore.\nLibrary Size\nThis should come as no surprise, but Lodash is a big library. In fact, if you\nmodularize your application, chances are it's bigger than your codebase. However, you can import only the modules you need if you have the propper plugins setup, such as babel-plugin-lodash or lodash-webpack-plugin.\nES6, on the other hand, won't add much bloat by default. It's efficiently transpiled into your code and only slightly increases transpiled size, plus chances are you have to use it\nanyways to gain other ownderful features.\nClean Code\nClean code is a big one. Let's take a look at what Lodash provides:\nNow who has written ugly code like that in the past? I know I have. Of course\nwe can imporove it, this is just to show how bad things can get.\nThis code is more organized. We can clearely see the two transformations, and\nthe data produced has descriptive names.\nThis is a coding practice I have seen a lot. Although it makes the code\neasier to read. It also demonstrates the weaknes of these abstractions. All we\nwanted was the final transformation. Instead we have an extra pice of data,\n`topTwo`, which has no use or reuse.\nLet's take a look at ES6 code to do the same thing.\nThis time we get rid of the intermedieate value and the code is more compact.\nIt's clear what's going on and we don't have functions wrapping everything.\nThis example barely scratches the surface of what's available with a transpiler\nand ES6. Much of the functionaly of Lodash is present in ES6. Please\ntake a look at the standard Array and Object methods available for more.\nWhere lodash is Still Ahead\nI can't go without saying that the nested object manipulation which Lodash\nprovides is far superior to what's available in ES6. The problem is that\nwe need to import the entirity of Lodash's core in order to get just a portion\nof the functionality that we will use. However, there is a solution.\nDon't Pick a Side\nYou might be thinking that you have a hard choice to make here. Well the good\nnews is, there is a middle ground that can yield the best of both worlds!\nI hope you remember Ramda from earlier. Well, Ramda doesn't have a\nbloated core that Lodash does. It lets you build your own version of\nRamda with only the functions you need. Such as the object manipulation code.\nIt has been brought up that Lodash is also modular. However, the size is only marginaly reduced due to how the core is used. In my experience, Ramda's size was greately reduced when only specific modules are used.\nLet's see our example with Ramda.\nThat looks really similar to the Lodash code. Ramda can do just\nabout everything Lodash can, but it can also do more.\nIf you payed close attention, you might have noticed that the arguments to the functions are\nreversed, from Lodash. Ramda encurages a different style of programing. It's one\nthat can lead to better code quality and composability, but there are other great articles that\ngo into all the features. Just take a look at the Ramda homepage for some great introductions.\nI will just show a small refactor.\nThis leaves us with two functions that do exactly one thing. We\nare able to compose these functions and apply them one by one to the data.\n`compose` makes this applcation even easier.\nThis has huge benefits compared to working with data like the previous examples.\nWe are able to resue the two functions for other team array, and can build them\nmore generically to allow for more reuse.\nAs it has been mentioned in the comments, much of the functionality of Ramda is actually available in Lodash through the recen addition of lodash-fp. I think both options are fine choices to imporove code reuse.\nConsider Your Options\nI don't mean to say that you should ditch Lodash and runaway from it like you\nprobably should with jQuery. What I want to bring to light is that there are\nmany alternatives. So you should consider your options next time you are looking\nfor a library like Lodash.\nI also want to praise Lodash. It moved JavaScript forward in a major way and\nwithout all the concepts it introduced I don't think ES6 or Ramda would look the\nsame. Lodash is the giant that influanced much of moder JavaScript and it's\nlibraries. It accomplished what many of us strive to do.

React provides fast\nperformance, easy ways to create shared components, and a plethora of\nlibraries. Redux lets you simplify state management in your\napplication, but it has serious drawbacks.\nIn large projects, Redux bloat your project with repetitive code. To\nsupport a single store update, you need to create a reducer that handles an\naction type which is dispatched from an action called inside a component. If\nthat process sounds tedious and confusing, that's because it is. You end up\nwith tons of simple actions and reducers that all look alike.\nPeople went to great lengths to combat this problem. Suggestions range from using\na new state management library, such as Mobx, to abandoning\nReact completely for\nsomething like Vue. These suggestions are like throwing the baby out\nwith the bath water. That's why I was happy to find\nRedux-Easy which didn't make me\nleave these libraries behind.\nEnter Redux-Easy\nRedux-Easy doesn't try to replace Redux or React. Instead, it removes the boilerplate and provides helper functions. You don't need to replace your entire code base. You can incrementally integrate Redux-Easy\nTo see how well it delivered on these promises, I decided to try it with the\nclassic Todo MVC application. The Redux library even\ncomes with an idiomatic example, which I used as a starting point.\nReducing Boilerplate Code\nRedux-Easy simplifies the creation of the store. Instead of manually creating\nthe store, passing it to the Provider, and wrapping your app in the\nProvider. You use reduxSetup to do all those steps for you:\nYou no longer manually group the actions handled by the reducer, nor combine\nthe reducers into to a single root reducer. Instead, you use addReducer. It\nmanages the root reducer for you, and you can add the handler from anywhere:\nIn vanilla Redux, you have to use mapDispatchToProps and\nmapStateToProps to pass in the dispatch actions and state.\nRedux-Easy\nprovides helpers that interact directly with the store.\nInstead of mapDispatchToProps, you use the provided dispatch function\nto fire off action:\nInstead of mapStateToProps, you wrap your component in a watch\nfunction. This functions lets you map object from the state using the state\npath:\nThese tools provide a way to reduce the setup of\nRedux. However, Redux-Easy\ndoesn't stop there.\nHelpers for Common Actions\nRedux-Easy provided dispatchSet, dispatchTransform, and dispatchDelete.\nThese are simple and flexible ways to manage simple modifications to your\nstate. For actions dealing with arrays, there are dispatchPush,\ndispatchFilter, and dispatchMap.\nThese helpers do what you would expect. They cover 80% of the actions\nyou need to perform on the store.\nWith actions like completeTodo, I reduced the traditional flow,\nspread cross 4 files, to a single function defined on the component using it:\ncompleteTodo is an example of modifying an array. It takes the store path\nand a function. Then it maps the function over the array pulled from the path.\nThe dispatch, action, and reducer are all taken care of by\nRedux-Easy\nConclusion\nRedux-Easy delivered on its promise of making Redux development shorter and\nsimpler. Using it, I removed 5 out of 7 action handlers. I reduce the lines of\ncode by 10% from 503 to 447, and the number of files by 30% from 20 to 14.\nMost importantly, organize the code became simpler. The state logic is\ncloser to where it's being used and is easier to follow.\nYou can find the full version of my TodoMVC using Redux-Easy\nhere.","id":"https://hackeryarn.com/post/making-redux-easy/","title":"Making Redux Easy"},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/maps/":{"body":"One of the most misused data structures is the humble map; hashmap,\ndictionary, hash table, etc.\nIt's a great data structure for quick storage and access of key value\npairs. Unfortunately, because of its ease and availability, it becomes\npervasive at jobs it has no business doing. The problem grows most\nvisible in dynamically typed languages that make the map a first class\ncitizen (Python, Ruby, Clojure, etc.), but it can creep up in any\nlanguage.\nPassing around data\nThis is the most common case where the map might tempt us. Let's play\nout a common scenario.\nWe have a some values that we need to pass to multiple functions. We\ndon't want to make all these functions take 5 new arguments, so what\ncan we do?\nWe can stick the values in a data structure. We could put them in a\nlist, but keeping the order and retrieving the value at the right\nlocation would quickly become error prone.\nInstead, we can give each value a short name and stick it in a map. Then\neach function can retrieve exactly what it needs and we don't have to\nworry about order. Everything works nicely.\nAfter a couple weeks, we decide to reuse one of the functions that takes\na map. But what keys did the function need from the map? That's easy\nenough to figure out. We pop open the source and take a peek. We see a\ncouple keys used, but then the map gets passed to another function. Time\nto look at the source of that function as well. We see 3 new keys here\nand 1 key used in the previous function. That make 4 keys total. Great!\nTime to... what were we doing before we started spelunking down this\ncall stack?

If we\nknow the keys of a map, we should not use a map. Instead, we should use\na struct, TypedDict, object, or any of the other abstraction that allow\nus to specify the expected keys and, hopefully, value types.\nBy using these other methods of specification, we enable:\nEasy lookup of keys\nStatic checks of the key names and value types\nInformative error messages if we make a mistake\nEditor assistance with supplying the right values\nJust by following this rule we can save our future self from frustration\nand reserve maps for what they are really meant for: storing large\nnumbers of key value pairs for fast lookup.","id":"https://hackeryarn.com/post/maps/","title":"You don't need a map for that"},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/picking-a-linux-distro/":{"body":"I recently started a new job that gave me the chance to run whatever Linux distribution would make me the most productive. In the face of complete freedom, I decided to re-evaluate my daily driver and see if there was a distribution that would give me the most up-to-date software while maintaining a stable system. The results of my search surprised even me.\nBackground\nI have ran Ubuntu on my home lab server for over a decade, and used it a daily driver from 2009 to 2014. I switched from Ubuntu because their package release cycle, even on the latest version, is too slow for my liking. At around the same time, rolling release distros were gaining popularity. So I jumped on the Arch train.\nThroughout the years I ran vanilla Arch, Manjaro, and most recently EndeavourOS. All these flavours of Arch had their own trade offs, but none of them felt quite stable enough. No matter which one I used, a few times a year an update would go so badly that I had to restore my entire system from backup. This made my backup practices much better, but didn't make me excited to use any of them for work.\nIn the search for stability, I also tried running NixOS in-between the Arch distros. NixOS had built-in snapshots for easy restores, and the base system was overall more stable. Unfortunately, there were still times when I had multiple packages break and I would be stuck not updating my system because the system update process was an all or nothing choice.\nThe biggest thing that made me stop using NixOS, however, was that they do things too differently from other Linux distros. NixOS requires most packages to have special configurations to work around the immutable file system, and all system changes need to be declared. This can definitely be an advantage, but it got too much for me when I just wanted things to work.\nAlthough I got my setup to be good, I had a nagging feeling that there had to be a better way. A way that would give me the best of both world. And now that I had a chance to really look, I was determined to find it.\nThe criteria for a new distro\nIn this search for a new distribution, I had 3 main criteria:\nA stable base system. I didn't want to have to re-install my base system multiple times per year.\nA rolling release cycle. I still believe that rolling releases are essential to running a solid system and keeping software up-to-date. After all, nobody wants to build 10 packages from source just to get a critical update working.\nThe ability to easily build fresh software and run packages. I did not want to jump through extra hoops to try out a new package or get obscure programs running.\nEliminating the distros\nArch and NixOS were quickly eliminated. Arch lacked the stability, and NixOS required extra steps to build and run anything.\nUbuntu and many of the other stable distros were also eliminated because of the lack of rolling releases. Fedora came close with their Rawhide releases, but that turned out to be more of a testing branch and less of a true rolling release process. Rawhide makes weaker stability claims than Arch, and therefore would not make a good work daily driver.\nWhile looking at Fedora, however, I noticed that they had a version called SilverBlue. This version ran an immutable file system (similar to NixOS), but promised to avoid the added overhead of NixOS.\nEnter the immutable distros\nSilverBlue made strong stability promises. In fact, stability was a core value of the entire project. But with my previous experience with NixOS, I had to wonder if SilverBlue would succumb to the same complexity trap of building on top of an immutable file system.\nTurns out, that SilverBlue takes quite a different approach from NixOS. Instead of encouraging the users to always update the base image and install packages at the base of the system, SilverBlue discourages any updates to the base system and instead uses flatpak for GUI tools and toolbox for development tools.\nflatpak should be familiar to anyone that has used a Mac or a smartphone. It allows installing Apps on the system. These apps will run on any Linux system, they ship with their dependencies, and you get to decide what access they get to your system. This the right way to run GUIs on any system, especially proprietary GUIs.\ntoolbox was a more radical idea. It completely changed the way I thought about running my development environment. Instead of setting up your development environment on the machine you're using, toolbox uses containers to create an environment that won't impact the rest of the system (similar to what flatpak does for GUI apps). The container still gets access to the user's home directory, the user's permissions, and even graphical sessions. So the whole experience doesn't feel like it's running in a container while providing all the benefits of container isolation.\nWith these features, it seemed like I found the distro of my dreams. But it was still missing true rolling releases.\nMicroOS\nThat's when I noticed a distro very close to SilverBlue: MicroOS by OpenSUSE. It had all the same ideas behind an immutable OS running most applications through flatpak, but it used distrobox instead of toolbox.\ndistrobox takes the ideas behind toolbox a step further. It allows creating a development environment using any Linux distribution. This means that if you have that one package on Arch that you just need to run, no problem, just spin up a new distrobox running Arch and install your package. If you need another close to production environment running Rocky Linux, no problem, just spin it up and test things there. You get the idea.\nFinally, and most importantly, OpenSUSE and MicroOS have a strong rolling release distro (tumbleweed). The packages released to this distro are backed by an amazing testing suite of OpenQA, so I can get the latest packages with a high level of confidence that they won't break my system. And if they do, MicroOS will use the built-in snapshots to roll back transactionally. That means no time wasted trying to rebuild my system and no time wasted configuring software just to run on this system.\nAnd speaking of not wasting any time. MicroOS will automatically install updates to your base system every night. This won't effect any of the things running on the system, but the next time you reboot, you will get the latest MicroOS release automatically.\nSo with this long journey, I landed on a distribution I never even heard of, with ideas I haven't considered. But all put together, this was the perfect distro for my use case.\nTLDR\nGive MicroOS a try. And even if you don't use it, start utilizing flatpak and distrobox to increase your system's stability and keep it from getting bloated with one-off packages.","id":"https://hackeryarn.com/post/picking-a-linux-distro/","title":"Picking a Linux Distro"},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/rails-csv-imports/":{"body":"Rails has great capabilities for working CSV files.

We noticed that the spikes were due to our CSV\nuploads.\nExamining CSV Import\nOur processor is responsible for bringing in coordinates\nfrom legacy systems and ones that cannot support our API.\nThe original code:\nLooking at this code, I quickly came to the assumption that\nread was storing the entire file in memory before parsing.\nWhich sent me on a search for a more efficient parsing method.\nBetter Parsing Method\nThrough my search, I came across an amazingly detailed article on how to get the\nmost memory efficient reads possible. It turns out, we were using the least\nefficient method to parse CSV files. I won't put all the statistics here because\nthe original article does a great deep dive on all the possibilities.\nI will only include the most efficient method, and the one we used.\nEfficient read code:\nThe change was minor. I had to use CSV.foreach instead of CSV.parse which\nperforms a line by line streaming traversal of the file. When working with files\nit is beneficial to have a stream. Streams only stores as much information as\nneeded during each cycle. In this case, it only needs one line.\nI also got to eliminate the manual read.

Making CSV imports a\nminor event for the server.\nReducing the Number of Creates\nHowever, while looking a the metrics around CSV imports I also noticed that it\ntook a long time to import a CSV. The most glaring suspect was the create on\nevery row.\nRails libraries come to the rescue! There is a great library,\nactiverecord-import, which allows for a singe database transaction for multiple\ncreates and doesn't complicate the code much.\nI eagerly tried to insert all the records in a single transaction. Although this\nhad some speed improvement, it shot up our memory consumption again. So I started\nexperimenting with intervals. With some trial and error, I arrived at 200\nrecords per transaction. It didn't consume too much memory and was actually the\nfastest. Anything below 200 created too many transactions and the efficiency\ndropped. Anything above 200 was creating too large of transactions for them to\nbe efficiently saved.\nMy final code:\nThis change required a bit more code. I had to maintain a list of locations to\nimport. Which I checked for the appropriate length, 200, every\niteration.\nOnce the file read was complete. I performed a final import to save\nany remaining locations. If the list was empty, it would\nresult in no import.\nThis final change improved our import time over 10x and made this small project\nmuch more worth it!","id":"https://hackeryarn.com/post/rails-csv-imports/","title":"Efficient CSV Imports in Rails"},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/rust-macros-1/":{"body":"Macros are required to do some very helpful things in Rust, but this isn't an article about any of those things.\nI became enamored with macros many years ago when I read Practical Common Lisp and saw the implementation of a SQL DSL that works with built in data structures.

This means that Tokenization and AST parsing has already occurred, so you can be sure that the what you work with is at least shaped like hypothetical Rust code.\nUnlike the Lisp family of languages, Rust had some additional challenges to overcome with their macro implementation.\nLisp has a syntax that's basically an AST, so it is extremely easy to consume and produce an AST, because it looks like normal code. Rust, on the other hand, looks nothing like Lisp or an AST, so it needs a way to elegantly handle these conversion steps. That's where the macro_rules! macro comes in, which will be the focus of this article.\nThe other challenge within macro_rules! comes from Rust's goal to provide as much help and correctness as possible. Rust actually supports types (technically fragment-specifiers) in macros. We will see more of this later, but it goes towards making macros easier to write, reason about, and maintain.\nWithout further ado, let's jump into using macro_rules! and declarative macros.\nMacro design process\nSince every time we write a macro, we create a DSL it's important to keep some rules and processes in mind. With that in mind, these are the typical steps that we should follow when writing macros:\nEvaluate if you need a macro\nDesign the simplest possible invocation first (determine what your DSL looks like)\nTry to implement a match arms and adjust the invocation as needed\nWork one match arm at a time\nWrite sub macros where possible\nSome of these steps might not mean much to you yet, but we will walk through them a few times while designing our final macro.\nDon't write macros\nBefore we start writing a macro, we should always evaluate if it is the best choice for the problem in hand. I know this is an odd step to start with for an article about writing macros, but macros get frequently abused, and we should strive to use all our tools well.\nMacros bring a lot of complexity in writing and debugging them. You are introducing another compilation step in your code, and often times erasing some of Rust's ability to help you write correct code. On top of all this, making code generic enough for macros can lead to far more complex types than you could accomplish with a little more boilerplate.\nBecause of this overhead, you have to really consider the trade offs that you're making. Rust is a powerful language with lots of abstractions. Often times, the existing tools can get you to your goal without resorting to macros.\nIn our case, we are writing the macro for practice, so these concerns don't apply here.\nThe simplest query! macro\nLets jump right to the second step and design our invocation:\ndb will be the data structure that we want to query. We will start with supporting a single argument select for picking a field from the items in the data structure. Working in the abstract makes it really hard to reason about how we want this structure to work, so let's put together some sample data.\nWe will borrow the domain from Practical Common Lisp and work with a list of songs. A song is a simple structure:\nAnd to make a database of songs, we can just throw a bunch of songs into a vector:\nNow if we come back to our invocation, we can fill in the desired output:\nOur first match arm\nNow that we know what we want our dsl to look like and what it should output, we can start working on our macro. Let's look at the implementation and fill in the gaps from there:\nIf you want to follow along, remember that macros need to be declared in their own module.\nThe basic syntax is ($matcher) =&gt; {$expansion}. If you squint, it looks just like a match statement, and that's what makes these types of macros so easy to work with.\nJust about everything in the matcher is treated as a literal. $ denotes a variable for what we actually want to capture. Everything that we capture must also have a fragment-specifier (you can think of it as a type). There are 14 possible fragment-specifiers that we could capture, see Metavariables for a full list, but in our case we are only capturing ident.\nident denotes an actual identifier or keyword declared somewhere outside the macro. We capture two identifiers. One for the database what we want to query, and one for the field that we want to extract.\nWe can run this declaration to make sure it executes without any error, but we won't see any result a until we implement the expansion.\nImplementing single field select\nNow that we have a match, we need to put it to use.\nThis is the part where we get to make the decisions of how our macro works. I am choosing to use into_iter so that our macro can work with anything that implements the Iterator trait. This is great for flexibility and an intuitive choice. But, it reveals a weakness of macros. We have no way to help the user know that they need to provide an Iterator. They would need to read the docs or guess correctly.\nYou can also see the flexibility of the ident fragment specifier. We are using it for a variable and a struct field name.\nWith this implementation we can actually run our macro, and get the expected output:\nAnd if we mistype the field name, we get a very helpful error message:\nConclusion... for now\nThis article sets up the groundwork for the macro that we want to build. Our goal is to get to macro like:\nIn the next part we will make progress toward that goal and explore some more advanced macro techniques.","id":"https://hackeryarn.com/post/rust-macros-1/","title":"Let's write a macro in Rust - Part 1"},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/rust-macros-2/":{"body":"In the last part we covered the very basics of macros and implemented a single argument query select. This was a good start, but only scratched the surface of what macros can do.\nIn this part we will implement multi-field select and a basic where clause. That will make our query macro far more useful.\nMulti-field select\nAfter being able to select one field, the immediate next thing that comes to mind is selecting multiple fields. Just like before, lets start with the invocation syntax:\nContinuing to draw inspiration from SQL, we use a comma separated list of fields. Using a separator, like a comma, turns out to be idiomatic Rust macro syntax for handling multiple value, so we are in luck with our choice.\nMatching multi-field select\nThat's quite a bit of new syntax, but it all breaks down to a single new matching construct.\nRepetition match syntax\nThe general shape for matching repetition looks like:\nWe need to wrap the repeating match expression in $(), add a separator (a comma in our case), and finish it with a repetition operator. The repetition operator should look familiar as they draw inspiration from regex:\n? for zero or one\n* for zero or more\n+ for one or more\nI chose to use + because a blank select makes no sense.\nThe matcher and expansion connect through the captured variable names, and repeat the same number of times. Everything inside the expansion parentheses ($()) repeats, so we need to be careful about any literals that we put into the expression.\nOnce we have the repeating match, we can use it in the expression.\nImplementing multi-field select\nYou might be surprised by the extra set of parentheses around the repetition usage. This is actually just a plain tuple.\nBecause we can return multiple fields, we have to create some kind of container. Since we can have fields of multiple types, a vector is out of the question. We could lean on serde and require a serializer instance, but that introduces a lot of overhead. A tuple gives us a simple wrapper that's easy to destructure and allows us to handle any number of fields with any mix of types.\nAnd with that, we can execute our query with a multi select:\nWe have to specify the type here, but if you were to use the values later, Rust's compiler can often infer the type.\nDebugging macros\nWith the repetition operators the macro gets hard to follow, and it will only get more complicated. This would be the perfect time to look at how we can debug macros.\nRust comes with everything we need built it. To see what macros expand to, we can run RUSTFLAGS=\"-Ztrace_macros\" cargo run (note that you will need nightly rust version). This gets pretty noisy, however, since it expands all macros in the entire program. To limit what expands, we can use a macro trace_macros!:\nThis limits the scope to only what we want to analyze and returns the the expected output:\nThe one odd thing about our debug output is the trailing comma in the tuple. Remember how I said that everything in the expansion $() repeats? We had a literal comma inside the repetition expansion so it gets included every time. Tuples and other collections allow trailing commas, but we will see some places, shortly, that do not.\nWhere clause\nSo far we only have a select macro which is not much of a query. Let's make our macro more useful:\nWe us = for comparison, and and as a way to support multiple comparisons. Just like with select, we will start by only supporting these two operators and work up to supporting others.\nMatching where clause\nWe actually already have all the tools we need to match this new syntax:\nWe will leave our earlier select without where arm as is, and start a new arm that includes where. This should look very familiar although slightly expanded. Our second repetition matcher captures two values ($test_field and $value) and uses a multi character separator (and) before the repetition operator. Both of these demonstrate the power and flexibility of macro matchers.\nThe only thing we have not seen yet is the use of a new fragment-specifier. The literal specifier lets us use the value exactly as it is. A string will be a string, a number a number, etc.\nImplementing where clause\nTo do the comparison, we add a call to .filter that will run the comparison based on the field identifier and the literal. This shows that the ident fragment-specifier works for a lot more identifiers than just variables.\nOne thing to note is that we had to put the &amp;&amp; outside the repetition parentheses. Unlike the tuple syntax, we can't have a dangling &amp;&amp; at the end of our conditional and putting it outside the parentheses will skip adding it to the last item.\nWith this arm implemented our previous select should continue to work and we can put the new where syntax to work:\nAs expected, we only get one item. As an additional sanity check, we can expand the macro again with trace_macos!:\nAnd we get the exact result we would expect. Both the condition appear in the filter expression, and they are separated by an &amp;&amp;.\nConclusion\nThis part expands the macro functionality to far more scenarios. It also covers all the major concepts of declarative macros. With these tools, you should be able to write a wide range of declarative macros.\nIn the next part we will look at handling multiple operators in our where clause. This will push our tools to their limit and we will need to use one of the most powerful pattern for declarative macros.","id":"https://hackeryarn.com/post/rust-macros-2/","title":"Let's write a macro in Rust - Part 2"},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/rust-macros-3/":{"body":"In the last part we covered all the fundamental techniques in writing macros. This enables us to write just about any macro we could think of, but knowing a few tricks can make the process much easier.\nIn this part, we will build on our where clause from the previous article. In the process we will allow the where clause to support multiple comparison operator (instead of just =) as well as multiple ways to join those operators (instead of just and).\nComplex where clause\nExactly what operator do we want to support? Lets add to our previous clause. Our macro should be able to support both of:\nWe can make this work, but it will result in more complexity than needed. Using the = operator means that we need to do a manual translation from = to Rust's == operator. If we just use == in our macro, we can use == and other Rust operators directly. Our updated syntax will look like:\nBut before we can implement the match arm, we need to talk about a concept that we've only skimmed over, so far.\nTokeTrees\nToken trees are a part of Rust's AST that makes it easy to work with macros by giving them explicit bounds.\nAlmost every token in the AST (2, \"hello\", etc.) represents a leaf. (), [], and {} are special tokens that start a new tree. A macro has to always take and produce a token tree, and that's exactly what our match arms represent. As far as macros care, all of the tree operators are interchangeable. So we could write our match arm as:\nOr call our macro as:\nAnd the compiler is perfectly happy. Although, readers of your code might not be.\nThis is all interesting background, but how will it help us write our macro? Token trees are one of the fragment-specifiers that we can match, and we can take advantage of that to write a very concise macro definition.\nMatching complex where clause\nWe use a repeating capture of tt (TokenTree) to capture every TokenTree that follows the word where. Since every token is either a leaf or separator, tt will capture everything. One important caveat here is that macros can't look ahead or behind, so if we use a repeating tt capture, we will capture the rest of the macro. There is no breaking out of a repeating tt capture.\nWe then use a helper macro, where_clause, to process the captured token tree. We also pass through i using an arbitrary separator ; which will make the implementation a little cleaner. Using helper macros is a common technique that reduces the number of match arms a single macro needs to implement.\nNow let's look at the where_clause macro that we need to implement. This will need a few clauses, and we will implement them one by one. We start with matching a single where clause with no and or or:\nThat's a lot of captures. The only literal in there, if you look closely enough, is ;. But we've seen all this before. The most surprising thing here is that to capture and use the comparison operator, $comp, we have to use tt. It took me a bit of trial and error to figure out that operators are not identifier or any kind of other fragment-specifier, so we have to use the most generic fragment-specifier tt.\nIncremental TT muncher\nTo implement the other cases, we have to use recursion. The arm we just implemented becomes the base case, and the other arms continuously call where_clause!:\nThe next two captures only differ in the separator (or and and). They both capture all the parts of a single comparison expression, just like the base case, and capture any remaining expression as a repeating tt. Then we can put together our conditional from and join it, using &amp;&amp; or ||, with another call to where_clause!. This is safe to do because we know that every arm of where_clause! will produce a valid conditional expression.\nStepping through complex expansions\nThat was a lot of abstract code. Luckily, we can use the debugging tools to get a clearer picture of how all of this evaluates:\nThe expansion becomes quite a bit more complex because we used helper macros, but it still clearly lists out all the steps. I usually have to read these types of expansions in a multi step process:\nScan everything from top to bottom to get the general idea of the expansion\nStart back from the bottom with the last line\nTake the line I am on (i.artist == \"Tool\")\nLook at the expansion above it (i.rating &gt; 9 || where_clause! (i; artist == \"Tool\"))\nSubstitute the line we started on into this expansion (i.rating &gt; 9 || i.artist == \"Tool\")\nIf there are more lines above, go back to step 3 using the substituted expansion from step 5, and repeat this until I am on the last (top most) line\nBy following this process I can see exactly what each step looks like and spot any problems that might occur.\nConclusion\nWith all these techniques under your belt, you should have no problem figuring out and implementing 90% of declarative macros.

They allow you to split up work across\nmutiple small functions, and you only pay\nfor what you use. On top of that, they require less maintenance than managing your own\nserver or Kubernetes cluster.\nHowever, the single function per lambda approach can become too granular. Shared\nfunctionality becomes hard to group together. You only have hard to enforce naming convention\nfor lambda that belong together. Then comes the problem of sharing code between lamdas. Do you need a library for a few common functions?\nI side with Sandy\nMetz in that\n\"duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction\". But that doesn't mean\nyou should give up the search for the right abstraction.\nThe Serverless Framework addresses some of these issues by letting you share code in the same project. However, it requires you to completely change how you process\nrequests. You can't rely on the same set of battle tested libraries that you\nuse would use elsewhere. If you later decide to switch to a microservice\narchitecture, you need to change large portions of your handlers. The Serverless\nFramework alone isn't enough.\nThe Right Abstractions\nI think having one action per lambda function is too granular. It\ngets rid of all the tooling built around handling web requests and routing.\nA single lambda should handle all the actions on a single resource. The\nfunction should know how to perform a Create, Read, Update, Delete, along with specialty methods.\nWith this in place, you share the most appropriate logic without needless\nindirection. It creates space to break up your code. The actions that\ndeal with the same resource are put together in one package. Everything else is\neither tied with its resource or abstracted into a general package.\nOther Benefits\nHaving a single lambda handle all the actions of a resource has a hidden\nperformance advantage. You see it when users perform multple actions on a single resource - a common scenario. The first action warms up the lambda, so subsequent request have better performance.\nThe best part is that the majority of your app can still follow the same pattern as\na microservice. If you need to move to a traditional server, the only thing you\nneed to change is a small wrapper around your router.\nLambdas give you great power, but you need to use them correctly to take\nfull advantage of it. An abstraction that adds to your code portability and\nusability is what you need to successfully work with lambdas.\nCreating a Multi-Route Lambdas\nYou will run into a problem when trying to create lambdas that handle multiple\nroutes. There isn't a built in mechanism for handling more than one actions in the\ncontext of a lambda. Luckily, there are many efforts in the community to make\nthis scenario possible.\nNo matter the technology you use, the communities create gateways that all work in a similar way.\nThey translate the requests intended for a lambda into requests\nthat a router can handle. You get to use the router and handlers\napproach you are used to while running your code in a lambda.\nThe following section shows how to apply this technique across Go and Node.js\nservers.\nGo\nIf you want to use this technique with Go, Apex gateway provides an easy way to translate lambda bound requests. You create your router as normal, pass the router to the http.Handle function, and use the gateway to start your server. Everything\nelse is taken care of by the library.\nNode.js and Express\nFor Express, there is the aws-serverless-express library. It allows you to wrap your normal express app is a server, and proxy it from a serverless handler.\nA Word of Warning\nThere is a scenario where this approach performs worse than multiple lambdas:\nrapid calls to different routes shared by a the same resource.\nLet's say we have a shopping app that models multiple actions on a cart\nresource.\nWhen a user checks out, two requests simultaneously fire for every item. The\nfirst, gets the current price. The second, gets the quantity ordered.\nFor now, we will ignore the glaring architecture issues with this implementation\nand focus on the performance implications for the lambdas. Both these scenarios\nassume identical conditions and warm lambdas at the start.\nIf we have a single lambda managing all the actions on the cart, as I\nsuggested, we will incur a cold start penalty on our second request. Because\nlambda can only process a single request at a time, the second request has to\nspin up a brand new instance of the lambda.\nIf we have a lambda per action, then each request will get an already warm\nlambda and we will have no performance penalty.\nThis is a weakness of my proposed solutions. Just like most, it's not a silver\nbullet. None the less, I still suggest sticking to the approach of multiple\nresources per lambda. Just be aware that if performance is key, you need to\nprofile for this scenario.","id":"https://hackeryarn.com/post/the-right-abstraction-for-lambdas/","title":"The Right Abstraction for Lambdas"},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/universal-haskell-dev-enviornment/":{"body":"Haskell is notoriously difficult to setup, which probably led to many people being scared away from ever getting started. However, there has been a lot of work done to address these short comings. And there is a way to setup a very pleasant environment thanks to the hard work of many projects.\nTraditional methods included:\nInstalling The Haskell Platform, which was a great project in it's time but always seems to lag a few GHC versions behind.\nRequired using a text editor like Vim or Emacs. These are incredible tools and productivity boosters, if you take the time to learn them. Which is a pretty major time commitment in itself I do suggest you learn one of these eventually, or use the vim/emacs mode of another tool.\nComplex package management through Cabal-Install. This tool caused either version hell from everything being installed globally or caused you to have to re-install all your dependencies for every project.\nTools of The Trade\nWe will be using these tools to solve the above problems and make the installation completely system agnostic. That's right, this installation process with work on any platform OS X, Linux, and even Windows.\nStack is probably the single biggest win for Haskell in the last year. It makes everything from freshly installing Haskell to creating and building new projects a no brainer.\nAtom has become one of my favorite text editors and has great support for Haskell.\nThose are the two major tools you will need to install and everything else is done through packages for them. Go ahead and install these from their respective websites.\nThe Setup\nNow let's crack open the terminal and configure our environment. All the commands will remain the same regardless of your operating system.\nLet's start by installing Haskell, or GHC to be more specific. Stack does not come GHC but it does come with an easy way to install it.\nNow you have a working version of GHC and you can drop into the repl at any time. Feel free to try this out with stack repl.\nNext let's install all our atom packages. Which is just one line! These packages include everything you would expect. Syntax highlights, code completion, linting, and even some auto formatting.\nYou must be outside of any stack project to run this command! This installs the binaries using your global configuration and not project specific setup. Which will make updating things in the future a little easier.\nghc-mod will do all heavy lifting for your setup. It's the backend for all the auto completion, linting, code validation, etc. While stylish-haskell will prettify your code.\nAt this point you need to check the output from stack to ensure that the binary install location has been added to your path. If it hasn't you will see a message instructing you on the exact folder that needs to be added.\nThat's it. This is all you need to have a working Haskell setup on any machine. If you want to try it out, go ahead and run stack new MyProject. This will create a fresh stack project and give you a few small sample file. If you try to define your own functions you should see code help and debug information just like you would expect.\nHappy hacking on your new setup!","id":"https://hackeryarn.com/post/universal-haskell-dev-enviornment/","title":"Easy Universal Haskell Development Environment"},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/universally-testable-dependencies/":{"body":"JavaScript dependencies are notoriously hard to mock and test across framework\nand environments. However, Dependency Injection (DI) ensures testability. It\nis common in statically typed languages, like Java or Go, but is also useful in\ndynamic languages like JavaScript.\nThis article will guide you through a simple technique that can apply\nto any JavaScript code base, frontend or backend, independent of frameworks\nand libraries.\nThe technique I am going to demonstrate is arguably not true DI, since the\ndependencies are still managed by the module using them. However, it\nsolves the dependency problem for testing which is the focus of this\narticle.\nWhy Do You Need DI?\nAt the most basic level, you need DI to avoid testing your dependencies.\nNot testing dependencies is a good idea for two reasons:\nYour dependencies should already be tested. This applies to both external dependencies as well as from your own project. If an external dependency doesn't have good testing, you probably shouldn't be using it or you should help them and add some tests!\nDependencies can do too much. Since dependencies exist outside of\nyour module's control, they can perform actions your module shouldn't be concerned with such as saving data, making web requests, or being algorithmically heavy.\nYour tests will be less complicated and faster if you avoid tesing dependencies because of the reasons mentioned above.\nSetting Up Your Code to Enable DI\nI am using Babel and\nJest throughout this guide. However,\nyou can easily adapt this technique to any JavaScript setup.\nTo start off, put all dependencies which should not execute during\na test into an exported deps object.\nOnce you have the deps object defined, you no longer reference the dependency\ndirectly. Instead, you call the appropriate dependency on the deps object.\nThat's all you need to make your dependencies testable in any context!\nYou will have the same level of testability across\nnode application using the require syntax, and front end application using\nthe ES6 import syntax without extra code.\nUsing the deps Object in Your Tests\nWith your module exporting all of its dependencies, your tests can\neasily mock or replace anything in the deps object.\nThe beforeAll block is the most important piece of code. Because\nwe are using functions from the deps object in our module code, we can\njust replace deps.longRunningFunction with anything we want before invoking\nthe module's default function.\nIn this example, we are using Jest's built in mock jest.fn().\nIt can produce a mock value to verify that our function returns the correct value and is called with the expected arguments.\nThe best part about testing this way is that we don't have to worry about\nany library's spying functions staying up to date with the JavaScript\nspecifications. Often times, spies don't work the same for all module syntaxes.\nIn fact, we don't have to use the mocks at all! We could write our\nown function with custom validators and set it as\ndeps.longRunningFunction.\nWrapping Up\nThis technique helped me immensely when maintaining long running or large\nJavaScript projects. It provided a minimal code approach that is easy to\nfollow even when you are brand new to the code base. I hope you found this\napproach useful and less complicated than other DI approaches.\nHappy testing!","id":"https://hackeryarn.com/post/universally-testable-dependencies/","title":"Universally Testable Dependencies in JavaScript"},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/why-i-built-a-static-site-in-clojure/":{"body":"At a summer barbecue, a friend asked if I could build a website for his\nnew restaurant.

So if you would like to\nhear more about a topic, please let me know!","id":"https://hackeryarn.com/post/your-job-isnt-writing-code/","title":"Your Job Isn't Writing Code"}},"docInfo":{"https://hackeryarn.com/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://hackeryarn.com/about/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://hackeryarn.com/about/me/":{"body":37,"title":0},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/async-python-benchmarks/":{"body":1072,"title":6},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/cli-in-emacs/":{"body":598,"title":3},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/clojure-actions/":{"body":263,"title":3},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/clojurescript-setup/":{"body":202,"title":5},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/distrobox/":{"body":513,"title":2},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/django-returns-1/":{"body":564,"title":6},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/django-returns-2/":{"body":436,"title":6},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/django-returns-3/":{"body":656,"title":6},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/dry/":{"body":1399,"title":3},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/embrace-the-constraints/":{"body":703,"title":2},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/hierarchies-in-hakyll/":{"body":331,"title":2},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/hy-django/":{"body":220,"title":2},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/local-common-lisp-projects/":{"body":190,"title":5},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/lodash/":{"body":495,"title":5},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/making-redux-easy/":{"body":345,"title":3},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/maps/":{"body":293,"title":3},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/picking-a-linux-distro/":{"body":638,"title":3},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/rails-csv-imports/":{"body":277,"title":4},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/rust-macros-1/":{"body":581,"title":6},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/rust-macros-2/":{"body":490,"title":6},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/rust-macros-3/":{"body":467,"title":6},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/the-right-abstraction-for-lambdas/":{"body":459,"title":3},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/universal-haskell-dev-enviornment/":{"body":309,"title":5},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/universally-testable-dependencies/":{"body":296,"title":4},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/why-i-built-a-static-site-in-clojure/":{"body":196,"title":4},"https://hackeryarn.com/post/your-job-isnt-writing-code/":{"body":311,"title":4}},"length":29},"lang":"English"}
