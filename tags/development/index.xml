      <title>You don&#39;t need a map for that</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most misused data structures is the humble map; hashmap,&#xA;dictionary, hash table, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a great data structure for quick storage and access of key value&#xA;pairs. Unfortunately, because of its ease and availability, it becomes&#xA;pervasive at jobs it has no business doing. The problem grows most&#xA;visible in dynamically typed languages that make the map a first class&#xA;citizen (Python, Ruby, Clojure, etc.), but it can creep up in any&#xA;language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>When DRY goes wrong</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DRY has become a mantra throughout the industry. Any time repetitive code shows up, DRY gets applied as a cure all. If you even start to question DRYing up a piece of code, you are viewed as a heretic to the entire industry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ok, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s not that bad, but many times DRY gets applied without much thought. This careless application of DRY leads to brittle code, making even simple changes scary because they could have a huge ripple effect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Embrace your constraints</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Engineers want to measure the quality and effectiveness of their work.&#xA;They turn to code coverage, burn down charts, and yearly goals, with the&#xA;best intention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These measurements provide quantitative data about how much planned work&#xA;was delivered, but they fail to tie the work to outcome. What good are&#xA;1,000 lines of code if the users never use the feature? These metrics&#xA;distract from the two question every professional should ask:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Right Abstraction for Lambdas</title>
      <link>https://hackeryarn.com/post/the-right-abstraction-for-lambdas/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Serverless functions are a great alternative for many light tasks that would&#xA;traditionally required a server. They allow you to split up work across&#xA;mutiple small functions, and you only pay&#xA;for what you use. On top of that, they require less maintenance than managing your own&#xA;server or Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the single function per lambda approach can become too granular. Shared&#xA;functionality becomes hard to group together. You only have hard to enforce naming convention&#xA;for lambda that belong together. Then comes the problem of sharing code between lamdas. Do you need a library for a few common functions?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Your Job Isn&#39;t Writing Code</title>
      <link>https://hackeryarn.com/post/your-job-isnt-writing-code/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every line of code you write is a liability. That line of code you just wrote&#xA;adds complexity to your code base, gives you more nuances to remember, it&#xA;might even be a bug. If code is so expensive and dangerous. What can you do?&#xA;After all, you are a developer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answer: You must remember your real job&amp;hellip; Delivering value to the users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Users don&amp;rsquo;t care what your class hierarchy looks like. They don&amp;rsquo;t care which&#xA;language or framework you&amp;rsquo;re using. They don&amp;rsquo;t even care if your system is a&#xA;cloud ready microservice. The user only cares that your product is helping them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
