      <title>The Right Abstraction for Lambdas</title>

      <description>Serverless functions are a great alternative for many light tasks that would traditionally required a server. They allow you to split up work across mutiple small functions, and you only pay for what you use. On top of that, they require less maintenance than managing your own server or Kubernetes cluster.
However, the single function per lambda approach can become too granular. Shared functionality becomes hard to group together. You only have hard to enforce naming convention for lambda that belong together.</description>

      <title>Making Redux Easy</title>

      <description>React and Redux are a top choice for front end projects. React provides fast performance, easy ways to create shared components, and a plethora of libraries. Redux lets you simplify state management in your application, but it has serious drawbacks.
In large projects, Redux bloat your project with repetitive code. To support a single store update, you need to create a reducer that handles an action type which is dispatched from an action called inside a component.</description>

      <description>Every line of code you write is a liability. That line of code you just wrote adds complexity to your code base, gives you more nuances to remember, it might even be a bug. If code is so expensive and dangerous. What can you do? After all, you are a developer.
The answer: You must remember your real job&amp;hellip; Delivering value to the users.
Users don&amp;rsquo;t care what your class hierarchy looks like.</description>

      <title>Universally Testable Dependencies in JavaScript</title>

      <description>JavaScript dependencies are notoriously hard to mock and test across framework and environments. However, Dependency Injection (DI) ensures testability. It is common in statically typed languages, like Java or Go, but is also useful in dynamic languages like JavaScript.
This article will guide you through a simple technique that can apply to any JavaScript code base, frontend or backend, independent of frameworks and libraries.
The technique I am going to demonstrate is arguably not true DI, since the dependencies are still managed by the module using them.</description>

      <description>A good development environment if fundamental to being productive. This is especially true for Lisps. A good environment can greatly speed up your development process and allow you to utilize the full power of Clojure or any other Lisp.
This tutorial is focused on a ClojureScript environment for a Leiningen based project being developed in Emacs.
Why Emacs? Emacs has a great setup for most programming languages but really shines when it comes to Lisps, including Clojure.</description>

      <title>Efficient CSV Imports in Rails</title>

      <description>Rails has great capabilities for working CSV files. However, like with many things, the most obvious way is not the most efficient.
We noticed this when our server had major fluctuations in memory consumption. After digging through metrics, made easy thanks to Prometheus and Grafana. We noticed that the spikes were due to our CSV uploads.
Examining CSV Import Our processor is responsible for bringing in coordinates from legacy systems and ones that cannot support our API.</description>

      <title>Easy Universal Haskell Development Environment</title>

      <description>Haskell is notoriously difficult to setup, which probably led to many people being scared away from ever getting started. However, there has been a lot of work done to address these short comings. And there is a way to setup a very pleasant environment thanks to the hard work of many projects.
Traditional methods included:
 Installing The Haskell Platform, which was a great project in it&amp;rsquo;s time but always seems to lag a few GHC versions behind.</description>
