      <description>&lt;p&gt;DRY has become a mantra throughout the industry. Any time repetitive code shows up, DRY gets applied as a cure all. If you even start to question DRYing up a piece of code, you are viewed as a heretic to the entire industry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ok, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s not that bad, but many times DRY gets applied without much thought. This careless application of DRY leads to brittle code, making even simple changes scary because they could have a huge ripple effect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
