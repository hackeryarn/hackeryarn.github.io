      <description>&lt;p&gt;Haskell is notoriously difficult to setup, which probably led to many people being scared away from ever getting started. However, there has been a lot of work done to address these short comings. And there is a way to setup a very pleasant environment thanks to the hard work of many projects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Traditional methods included:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Installing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.haskell.org/platform/&#34;&gt;The Haskell Platform&lt;/a&gt;, which was a great project in it&amp;rsquo;s time but always seems to lag a few GHC versions behind.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Required using a text editor like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vim.org/&#34;&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/&#34;&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt;. These are incredible tools and productivity boosters, if you take the time to learn them. Which is a pretty major time commitment in itself &lt;em&gt;I do suggest you learn one of these eventually, or use the vim/emacs mode of another tool.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Complex package management through &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.haskell.org/Cabal-Install&#34;&gt;Cabal-Install&lt;/a&gt;. This tool caused either version hell from everything being installed globally or caused you to have to re-install all your dependencies for every project.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;tools-of-the-trade&#34;&gt;Tools of The Trade&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We will be using these tools to solve the above problems and make the installation completely system agnostic. That&amp;rsquo;s right, this installation process with work on any platform OS X, Linux, and even Windows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
