      <description>I recently started a new job that gave me the chance to run whatever Linux distribution would make me the most productive. In the face of complete freedom, I decided to re-evaluate my daily driver and see if there was a distribution that would give me the most up-to-date software while maintaining a stable system. The results of my search surprised even me.
Background I have ran Ubuntu on my home lab server for over a decade, and used it a daily driver from 2009 to 2014.</description>
