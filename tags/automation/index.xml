      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xA;I recently took over the maintenance of an open source Clojure project. One of the first things I noticed was the lack CI or CD. These are things that aren&amp;#39;t required but can save a lot of work, especially for a public project.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;The CI portion helps make sure that all pull requests pass tests and conform to the project&amp;#39;s coding style. The CD portion helps with deploying the project. And these parts become especially important if the project is in maintenance mode.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
