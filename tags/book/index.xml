      <description>Recently I ran an experiment of posting daily reading notes on this blog. This was very much a personal experiment.
Making these posts every day reinforced my reading habit. I felt motivated to set aside time to read, and I got the chance to reflect on my reading. It also provided the opportunity to share more with others.
I plan on keeping this habit going, but this blog isn&amp;rsquo;t the right place for it.</description>
