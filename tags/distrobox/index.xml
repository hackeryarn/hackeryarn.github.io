      <description>Distrobox is the single piece of software that completely changed the way I work. If you&amp;rsquo;ve hear of or used Vagrant and thought it was a great idea but implemented in a really heavy handed manner, then Distrobox is exactly what you&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for.
Within a month Distrobox became my primary dev environment and that hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed for over a year. In this post I hope to share how I use Distrobox and give you some tips for making the experience even better.</description>
