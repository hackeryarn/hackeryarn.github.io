      <title>Universally Testable Dependencies in JavaScript</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;JavaScript dependencies are notoriously hard to mock and test across framework&#xA;and environments. However, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection%3CPaste%3E&#34;&gt;Dependency Injection&lt;/a&gt; (DI) ensures testability. It&#xA;is common in statically typed languages, like Java or Go, but is also useful in&#xA;dynamic languages like JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This article will guide you through a simple technique that can apply&#xA;to any JavaScript code base, frontend or backend, independent of frameworks&#xA;and libraries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The technique I am going to demonstrate is arguably not true DI, since the&#xA;dependencies are still managed by the module using them. However, it&#xA;solves the dependency problem for testing which is the focus of this&#xA;article.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How Lodash Worked Itself Out of a Job</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I really loved lodash. It brough the joy of compact functional code to&#xA;JavaScript. Especially 6 years ago when I first embraced it. It was a wonderful library.&#xA;Back then, there was no ES6, no Babel, and terrible browser incompatabilities&#xA;ran rampant. Lodash along with jQuery were the saving light of that time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I gravitated towards using Lodash because the first language I learned was&#xA;Scheme. It had functional programing at it&amp;rsquo;s core, and highly influanced how I&#xA;think about code to this day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
