      <description>At a summer barbecue, a friend asked if I could build a website for his new restaurant. But what he didn&#39;t know was that I haven&#39;t built a static site in nearly a decade. However I couldn&#39;t let him spend thousands of dollars on a cookie cutter website designed by a firm that knew nothing about his restaurant.
We started coming up with ideas right away over a couple of beers.</description>
