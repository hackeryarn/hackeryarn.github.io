      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xA;At a summer barbecue, a friend asked if I could build a website for his new&#xA;restaurant. But what he didn&amp;#39;t know was that I haven&amp;#39;t built a static site in nearly a&#xA;decade. However I couldn&amp;#39;t let him spend thousands of dollars on a cookie cutter&#xA;website designed by a firm that knew nothing about his restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;We started coming up with ideas right away over a couple of beers.&#xA;He wanted manageable content, an Instagram feed, and an easy to change restaurant&#xA;menu. It quickly started sounding like a full on Content Management System and&#xA;not a simple website. I had to reel in this ambitious project before it&#xA;became a feature sink. So we decided to just make a beautiful static site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
