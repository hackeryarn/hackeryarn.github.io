        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the most misused data structures is the humble map; hashmap,
dictionary, hash table, etc.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s a great data structure for quick storage and access of key value
pairs. Unfortunately, because of its ease and availability, it becomes
pervasive at jobs it has no business doing. The problem grows most
visible in dynamically typed languages that make the map a first class
citizen (Python, Ruby, Clojure, etc.), but it can creep up in any
language.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</summary>

The results of my search surprised even me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</summary>

Back then, there was no ES6, no Babel, and terrible browser incompatabilities
ran rampant. Lodash along with jQuery were the saving light of that time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</summary>
