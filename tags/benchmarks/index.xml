      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Python community is abuzz with excitement about better async support. If you have an existing service, you might wonder if you&amp;rsquo;re missing out.

Unless you run in a highly distributed environment and your service is the bottleneck, needing 10 instances just to keep up with all the traffic, you probably won&amp;rsquo;t see the benefits that most benchmarks promise. In fact, you might see worse performance by switching.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
