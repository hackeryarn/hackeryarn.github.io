      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://distrobox.privatedns.org/&#34;&gt;Distrobox&lt;/a&gt; is the single piece of software that completely changed the way I work. If you&amp;rsquo;ve hear of or used &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vagrantup.com/&#34;&gt;Vagrant&lt;/a&gt; and thought it was a great idea but implemented in a really heavy handed manner, then Distrobox is exactly what you&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Within a month Distrobox became my primary dev environment and that hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed for over a year. In this post I hope to share how I use Distrobox and give you some tips for making the experience even better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Picking a Linux Distro</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently started a new job that gave me the chance to run whatever Linux distribution would make me the most productive. In the face of complete freedom, I decided to re-evaluate my daily driver and see if there was a distribution that would give me the most up-to-date software while maintaining a stable system. The results of my search surprised even me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have ran Ubuntu on my home lab server for over a decade, and used it a daily driver from 2009 to 2014. I switched from Ubuntu because their package release cycle, even on the latest version, is too slow for my liking. At around the same time, rolling release distros were gaining popularity. So I jumped on the Arch train.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
