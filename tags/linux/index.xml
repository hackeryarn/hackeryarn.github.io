      <description>Distrobox is the single piece of software that completely changed the way I work. If you&amp;rsquo;ve hear of or used Vagrant and thought it was a great idea but implemented in a really heavy handed manner, then Distrobox is exactly what you&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for.&#xA;Within a month Distrobox became my primary dev environment and that hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed for over a year. In this post I hope to share how I use Distrobox and give you some tips for making the experience even better.</description>

      <description>I recently started a new job that gave me the chance to run whatever Linux distribution would make me the most productive. In the face of complete freedom, I decided to re-evaluate my daily driver and see if there was a distribution that would give me the most up-to-date software while maintaining a stable system. The results of my search surprised even me.&#xA;Background I have ran Ubuntu on my home lab server for over a decade, and used it a daily driver from 2009 to 2014.</description>
