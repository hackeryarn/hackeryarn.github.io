      <description>Throughout the years humanity saw many problems with dictatorship. People have a tendency to become selfish and make decisions that cause harm to the many to serve the few. So people learned to avoid putting all the power in the hands of a single individual.
More recently we are seeing problems with a fully equal democracy. Especially when making decisions with people of different believability. If you wanted to learn to throw a punch, would you listen to prized fighter or a couch potato?</description>

      <description>A discussions with no resolution is a waste. Don&amp;rsquo;t be a victim of that time sinks. If you get a meeting that can be resolved with an email, be the one to send that email. Resolve the meeting before it even happens. However, there are important meetings. You can still drive these to a conclusion.
To have a successful meeting, go in with a plan. Know what issues you will be tackling and structure the meeting accordingly.</description>

      <description>People will care about the culture if they find their work and relationships meaningful. This type of culture can&amp;rsquo;t happen on its own. You have to cultivate it by empowering the people with the right attitude while letting go people that are a negative to the culture. This approach is the definition of tough love.
You should deeply care for the people that are working for you. Making it a safe environment where people are allowed to make mistakes.</description>

      <description>Radical truthfulness is the corner stone of the most important things in life. It allows you to build stronger relationships. You won&amp;rsquo;t try to &amp;ldquo;protect&amp;rdquo; people from difficult situation, and instead give them time to prepare. You will grow closer than ever because there won&amp;rsquo;t be hidden agendas or tricks.
Ultimately, you can only control yourself in being radically truthful, but this behavior is contagious. Those that get it won&amp;rsquo;t want to operate any other way.</description>

      <description>There are undeniable correlations between life and work. Both are built on relationships, both are driven and improved by the people you surround yourself with.
Many of the things people pursue are a byproduct of the people an culture they create around them. If money is your goal, you will never make much by just chasing money. The way to make money is to become excellent and valuable at what you do.</description>

      <description>The fastest way to improve your life is to learn to make better decisions. There are three steps to making better decisions.
Gather enough information to increase your odds of making the correct decision. When doing this, remember the 80&amp;frasl;20 rule and weigh the cost of delaying the decision vs the cost of being wrong.
Find common patterns in your decision making and turn them into principles. Simplify your decision making process to a level where anyone can take your explanation and make the same decision you would have.</description>

      <description>There are many kind of people. All of them with their own strength and weaknesses. No matter how far you have gotten on your own, you will hit a wall when you need the help of others. The human species didn&amp;rsquo;t survive this long because of the brilliants of the hermits. It survived because human have learned to work together in large groups.
So be open to the help and input of others.</description>

      <description>Being open minded is one of the hardest things you can do. It required you to go against your baser instincts when they are at their strongest. You have to face your fears of shame, failure, and humiliation head on.
However, through these battles you gain the truth. You get to make better decisions, see the world in new ways, and constantly improve. By being radically open minded, you unlock your potential.</description>

      <description>For life long success, there are 5 steps you need to perform well.
Set goals that are outside your reach. Don&amp;rsquo;t settle for what you know you can accomplish. Push yourself to new heights.
Identify the problems you run into. Because the goal is outside your reach, you will inevitably run into problems. Don&amp;rsquo;t sweep them under the rug, but embrace them. They are the most valuable lessons you will learn.</description>

      <description>Pain is the best teacher. By being uncomfortable and failing, you are given opportunities to grow. We don&amp;rsquo;t see these situation as opportunities because we only evaluate the first level consequences.
Like working out, the first level consequence is the pain and struggle you feel while working out, but if you look a little further down the line there are many benefits. You will feel better, live longer, and look better.</description>

      <description>Before you can develop a good set of principles you need to come face to face with reality. Not the reality you wish was here, but the harsh reality that you are living in. See your flaws and failures for what they really are. Be brutally honest with yourself.
Then you can be radically honest with those around you. If you are honest with them, they will be honest with you.</description>

      <description>The economy is built from simple transactions. You take assets or credit and exchange it for goods, services, or financial assets. That&amp;rsquo;s it. This process is repeated countless times in countless scenarios to build up the overall economy.
You gain true clarity when you see a complex system as a combination of it&amp;rsquo;s simple parts. This type of understanding applies to many things in life. By reducing your problems to their simpler parts, you gain the ability to tackle even the most challenging task.</description>

      <description>Ray Dalio turned his everyday decisions into systems. He started by compiling the reasons for each choice. Then he aligned the reasoning with the category it applies to. Because there are fever types of decisions than there are decisions to make, he could streamline decision making.
Finally, he leveraged the power of computers. Algorithms don&amp;rsquo;t have biases, they don&amp;rsquo;t get emotionally attached, you can back test them, you can collaborated on them, and you can easily change them.</description>

      <description>If you want to be successful, you need to leverage everything around you. Your intuition, technology, and the knowledge of others melded together. With more input you can make better decision.
However, no matter how much input you get, remember to not get greedy. When you want ever more and get out of balance you run the risk of losing more than you can handle. Instead, make intelligent adjustment. You will still have a huge upside but with the assurance that you won&amp;rsquo;t lose it all.</description>

      <description>Making many balanced and uncorrelated bets is the best way to minimize your risk while keeping the gains. If your bets become correlated, you lose the benefit of diversification because more of your portfolio can be effected by a single event.
In order to understand correlations, you won&amp;rsquo;t only need to understand markets. You will need to understand people. Try to understand why opinions differ, even if they are at complete odds with you.</description>

      <description>No matter how prepared you are, fate is unpredictable and you will face a loss. It&amp;rsquo;s unavoidable.
The import thing is to make sure you can handle a loss. Minimizing your down sides by finding your neutral point. An equilibrium where you are not loosing anything and you can sustain indefinitely. Once you identify this point, you can take calculated risks outside of it. Knowing that you have a cushion at your neutral point.</description>

      <description>Conclusion on negotiation In every negotiation you should address emotions, strive to understand the other side, and use facts. This gives you more than an argument. It gives you a way to get a better outcome in any situation, even with people who are the complete opposites of you.
To make the negotiation go smoothly, prepare yourself for the negotiation. Thoroughly research the subject so you can present strong reasoning for your arguments.</description>

      <description>What if They Use Dirty Tricks? A bad negotiation can destroy a relationship. Don&amp;rsquo;t let your emotions flair at the first sight of an unpleasant technique being used. Thy are using a technique because because the negotiation is important to them too.
You can point out the technique. This alone can be enough to get the discussion back on track. You can ask for factual clarification of their position. This will give you more information about where they stand and could make them realize their position is unreasonable.</description>

      <description>What if They Won&amp;rsquo;t Play Just like in martial arts, there is a better way to approach disagreement than head on. You can redirect their push to your advantage.
They may criticize you, attack your ideas, or dig their feet in. Don&amp;rsquo;t get defensive or take an attack personally. Use their feedback to further the analysis of the problem. Don&amp;rsquo;t try to change their position. Ask questions about their position to help you come up with alternatives.</description>

Chances are, you hit it like a giant road block every time they suggested an alternative. You weren&amp;rsquo;t actually considering any offer that didn&amp;rsquo;t first meet your bottom line.
Where did you bottom line come from? Was it from a discussion with your family? Or was it because you thought there would be job offers lining up?</description>

      <description>Insist on Using Objective Criteria Don&amp;rsquo;t take offers at face value. Try to figure out the objective reasoning behind the offer. Just asking about the reasoning makes the other person evaluate their position. Once they are in an evaluation mode, it opens up the floor for you to present your reasoning.
With all the reasoning is on the table, insist on a fair process. Be ready to compromise between two equally worthy criteria.</description>

      <description>Invent Options for Mutual Gain You can&amp;rsquo;t settle on a good outcome without having the right ideas. Separate your brainstorming from the decision process. Ban judgment and throw out the craziest ideas you can. Then use those ideas as launchpads for refinement.
Try to understand why everyone came up with different ideas. Use these differences in values, believes, and interests to settle on an outcome. You can&amp;rsquo;t reach an agreement without differences.</description>

      <description>Focus on Interest not Positions Negotiations start because both parties have an interest. They use their interests to develop a position. Conflict arises because each parties sees their position as the only way to succeed. And bot parties end up upset with each other or losing out on a lot of what they wanted.
That entire situation can be avoided. Don&amp;rsquo;t come up with your position before you talk to the other person.</description>

      <description>Separate the people from the problem It&amp;rsquo;s not enough to address the problem objectively. Every negotiation also involves people. With people come people problems that are separate from the main issue at hand.
First off you need to understand the other parties perspective. They might not see things the same way. They might hold biases. Or they might feel like they didn&amp;rsquo;t get to participate in the process and are getting a solution force onto them.</description>

      <description>The problem We negotiate every day. Everything from a pay raise, to what to have for dinner is a negotiation. The only thing that changes is the stakes.
We generally view negotiations as having two outcomes. Either we give something up or we win by making the other person give something up. This is a sad zero sum view of the world. It&amp;rsquo;s the view of if there is a winner there must be a loser.</description>

      <description>The U-Boat is Our Moment Kohler and Chatterton lost their families because of the obsession with the u-boat. It might have worked out for Kohler, but Chatterton is getting dangerously close to sacrificing everything for this wreck.
Many people that accomplished great things let themselves become consumed by an idea. But it&amp;rsquo;s not the only way. You can approach problems with moderation and longevity. If you can&amp;rsquo;t find a solution to the problem after giving it your all, move on.</description>

      <description>None of us is coming back The command and first officer couldn&amp;rsquo;t be more different in their leadership style.
The commander treated every situation with the utmost professionalism. He won the man&amp;rsquo;s trust through his discipline.
The first officer was the complete opposite. He was friendly and open with the men. The whole crew became his friends. They laughed and joked around every time they were off duty.
Despite these differences, they both respected each other.</description>

      <description>A missed signal Chatterton tried a new strategy for exploring the u-boat. Instead of rummaging through the debris, he stopped and calmly absorbed his surrounding. Allowing himself to notice more than he had before.
Taking it slow , especially with tough problem, can be seem counter productive. You want to start resolving the problem right away. However, there is a better strategy. If you take a step back and allow yourself room to process, you gain insight you previously wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have.</description>

      <description>History Mauled Chatterton and Kohler finally found the identity of the sub. To achieve this, they had to go against historical books. They read the actual communications and proved even the experts wrong.
As said by Mark Twain: &amp;ldquo;Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.&amp;rdquo; Question the common wisdom if things don&amp;rsquo;t line up. History books have been rewritten. Scientists actively work to prove each other wrong.</description>

      <description>A Heavy Toll Chatterton and Kohler were becoming frustrated. They performed numerous dives but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a scrap of identification. The one place they didn&amp;rsquo;t check were the well preserved human remains.
Despite the allure of easy information, they quickly decided against it. Not because someone would find out. They were at 230 feet with no one else round. They would touch the remains out of pure respect for the soldiers.</description>

      <description>Nothing at That Location Chatterton approaches research and diving the same way. He gets the big picture first. Scanning at the highest and safest level. Building a game plan and gathering valuable information.
Once he finds something promising, he dives in as deep as possible. Gleaning everything he can from the best opportunity the situation presents to him.
This is a great way to approach your problem. Spend some time upfront making sure you are tackling the right problem.</description>

      <description>Horenburg&amp;rsquo;s Knife Nagel and Chatterton tried to keep the u-boat a secret and do research on their own. But they could only get so far on the on their own.
When they caved and put out a press release about their discovery, they got more information in a week than in months of research. Others got excited about the discovery, they had a passion for u-boats, or lived during the period.</description>

      <description>Richie Kohler A man built on self education and strong work ethic. He gets genuinely excited about shipwreck diving and the artifacts he can find.
We all enjoy an activity because we find pleasure in the little things about that activity. Often people enjoy different aspects. Chatterton enjoys the story of the submarines while Kohler enjoys the artifacts he can find. This difference made Chatterton misjudged Kohler for a bad guy.</description>

      <description>Crazy Deep The divers forgot their limit on a deep dive. They became caught up in the excitement and push further than they ever have.
It can be healthy to push yourself, but you need to know your limits. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to be too uncomfortable in a situation. Neither do you want to repeatedly push yourself further than you have gone before.
Feldman learned this lesson the hard way by going on the deepest dive he&amp;rsquo;s ever attempted two times in a row.</description>

      <description>John Chatterton A man on an endless quest of self exploration. John Chatterton didn&amp;rsquo;t follow other advice. Instead, he followed his own path. He chose to get answers through experience in the army, volunteering for Vietnam, and becoming a commercial diver.
In all his endeavors, he gave everything and learned every detail. An attitude like this lead to him becomes great at his vocation.
Taking on the tasks no one likes, giving everything to every job, and learning the smallest detail are the values of a great professional.</description>

      <description>A Shape of Power The divers were ecstatic to find a mysterious u-boat where no u-boat should have been. They dove in ready to take full advantage of they 25 minutes they had to look at the submarine. Everyone explored a different part and grew more excited with each new discovery.
Once the expedition was over, everyone handled the secret of the u-boat differently. Some dove into research, some couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist telling a friend, and others visited submarines at a museum.</description>

      <description>Zero Viz Shipwreck divers face countless dangers. When going down they could lose the line, get caught up in a current, or become intoxicated by nitrogen. Inside the wreck, they can easily get lost or snagged on debris. And on the way up they can suffer permanent injury or death from the bends.
They only have one prevention for all these troubles. Staying calm and solving their problems one at time.</description>

      <description>The Book of Number Sailors hold their most secret spots in a book of numbers. Some use these numbers as their lively hood by taking others there for fishing. Others do it for the thrill of exploring the unknown. They love the exploration and aren&amp;rsquo;t concerned if it&amp;rsquo;s a great wreck or a literal pile of garbage.
This passion echoes across disciplines. No matter the vocation, there are those that enjoy every minute of what they do.</description>

      <description>Question the norm and default to no  &amp;ldquo;Culture is what culture does.&amp;rdquo;
 Don&amp;rsquo;t base your culture on best practices. In fact, don&amp;rsquo;t base anything on best practices alone. Only use these practices as a starting point. Strive to push things forward and create something better than the status quo.
To become better than the norm, you need focus. The only way to gain focus is to say no to all the unnecessary things you are saying yes to right now.</description>

 &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s really easy to fall for someone&amp;rsquo;s carefully crafted story.&amp;rdquo;
When hiring or just working with someone, get to know them as a person. Everyone has families, hobbies, and worries. Get to know these things, about the people you spend 40 hours a week with. It leads to a better work environment and make sharing ideas easier.</description>

      <description>Your words carry more power than you think  &amp;ldquo;1 percent occasions like that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t drive policy 99 percent of the time.&amp;rdquo;
 Chances are, you have someone looking up to you or you are an officially a leader. This comes with great responsibility.
Be careful with the example that you set and what you give you attention to. Staying up late, responding to emails on the weekends, and looking at thing &amp;ldquo;just in case&amp;rdquo; all serve to create a bad culture around you.</description>

      <description>Calm is the Secret to Great Work  &amp;ldquo;Comparison is the death of joy.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ndash; Mark Twain
 Drawn out goals, packed schedules, and crazy work environments sap the calm from any workspace.
Remember that packing your schedule and trying to get more done is not the way to stay creative. Instead allow yourself uninterrupted chunks of time, at least 90 minutes to work. Use this time to to accomplish what you need to and produce something of quality.</description>

      <description>At a summer barbecue, a friend asked if I could build a website for his new restaurant. But what he didn&#39;t know was that I haven&#39;t built a static site in nearly a decade. However I couldn&#39;t let him spend thousands of dollars on a cookie cutter website designed by a firm that knew nothing about his restaurant.
We started coming up with ideas right away over a couple of beers.</description>

      <description>Every line of code you write is a liability. That line of code you just wrote adds complexity to your code base, gives you more nuances to remember, it might even be a bug. If code is so expensive and dangerous. What can you do? After all, you are a developer.
The answer: You must remember your real job&amp;hellip; Delivering value to the users.

      <description>JavaScript dependencies are notoriously hard to mock and test across framework and environments. However, Dependency Injection (DI) ensures testability. It is common in statically typed languages, like Java or Go, but is also useful in dynamic languages like JavaScript.
This article will guide you through a simple technique that can apply to any JavaScript code base, frontend or backend, independent of frameworks and libraries.
The technique I am going to demonstrate is arguably not true DI, since the dependencies are still managed by the module using them.</description>

      <description>A good development environment if fundamental to being productive. This is especially true for Lisps. A good environment can greatly speed up your development process and allow you to utilize the full power of Clojure or any other Lisp.
This tutorial is focused on a ClojureScript environment for a Leiningen based project being developed in Emacs.
Why Emacs? Emacs has a great setup for most programming languages but really shines when it comes to Lisps, including Clojure.</description>

      <description>I really loved lodash. It brough the joy of compact functional code to JavaScript. Especially 6 years ago when I first embraced it. It was a wonderful library. Back then, there was no ES6, no Babel, and terrible browser incompatabilities ran rampant. Lodash along with jQuery were the saving light of that time.
I gravitated towards using Lodash because the first language I learned was Scheme. It had functional programing at it&amp;rsquo;s core, and highly influanced how I think about code to this day.</description>

      <description>Rails has great capabilities for working CSV files. However, like with many things, the most obvious way is not the most efficient.
We noticed this when our server had major fluctuations in memory consumption. After digging through metrics, made easy thanks to Prometheus and Grafana. We noticed that the spikes were due to our CSV uploads.
Examining CSV Import Our processor is responsible for bringing in coordinates from legacy systems and ones that cannot support our API.</description>

      <description>I recently gave a talk, at the local Fullstack Meetup, on the Phoenix Framework. Phoenix is the de facto web framework for Elixir.
In this talk, I cover some of the best features of Phoenix:
 Erlang: The platmor which Elixir and Phoenix are build on. (albeit very brief overview of the major features) Plug: The specification for composable module design that gives Phoenix much of it&amp;rsquo;s power. Ecto: The database integration layer.</description>

      <description>Haskell is notoriously difficult to setup, which probably led to many people being scared away from ever getting started. However, there has been a lot of work done to address these short comings. And there is a way to setup a very pleasant environment thanks to the hard work of many projects.
Traditional methods included:
 Installing The Haskell Platform, which was a great project in it&amp;rsquo;s time but always seems to lag a few GHC versions behind.</description>
