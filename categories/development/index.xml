      <title>You don&#39;t need a map for that</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xA;One of the most misused data structures is the humble map; hashmap, dictionary, hash table, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;It&amp;#39;s a great data structure for quick storage and access of key value pairs. Unfortunately, because of its ease and availability, it becomes pervasive at jobs it has no business doing. The problem grows most visible in dynamically typed languages that make the map a first class citizen (Python, Ruby, Clojure, etc.), but it can creep up in any language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Your Job Isn&#39;t Writing Code</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every line of code you write is a liability. That line of code you just wrote&#xA;adds complexity to your code base, gives you more nuances to remember, it&#xA;might even be a bug. If code is so expensive and dangerous. What can you do?&#xA;After all, you are a developer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answer: You must remember your real job&amp;hellip; Delivering value to the users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Users don&amp;rsquo;t care what your class hierarchy looks like. They don&amp;rsquo;t care which&#xA;language or framework you&amp;rsquo;re using. They don&amp;rsquo;t even care if your system is a&#xA;cloud ready microservice. The user only cares that your product is helping them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
