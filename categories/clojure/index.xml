      <description>I recently took over the maintenance of an open source Clojure project. One of the first things I noticed was the lack CI or CD. These are things that aren&amp;#39;t required but can save a lot of work, especially for a public project.
The CI portion helps make sure that all pull requests pass tests and conform to the project&amp;#39;s coding style. The CD portion helps with deploying the project.</description>

      <description>At a summer barbecue, a friend asked if I could build a website for his new restaurant. But what he didn&amp;#39;t know was that I haven&amp;#39;t built a static site in nearly a decade. However I couldn&amp;#39;t let him spend thousands of dollars on a cookie cutter website designed by a firm that knew nothing about his restaurant.
We started coming up with ideas right away over a couple of beers.</description>
