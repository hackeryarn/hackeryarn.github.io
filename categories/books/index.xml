      <description>Your words carry more power than you think  &amp;ldquo;1 percent occasions like that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t drive policy 99 percent of the time.&amp;rdquo;
 Chances are, you have someone looking up to you or you are an officially a leader. This comes with great responsibility.
Be careful with the example that you set and what you give you attention to. Staying up late, responding to emails on the weekends, and looking at thing &amp;ldquo;just in case&amp;rdquo; all serve to create a bad culture around you.</description>

      <description>Calm is the Secret to Great Work  &amp;ldquo;Comparison is the death of joy.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ndash; Mark Twain
 Drawn out goals, packed schedules, and crazy work environments sap the calm from any workspace.
Remember that packing your schedule and trying to get more done is not the way to stay creative. Instead allow yourself uninterrupted chunks of time, at least 90 minutes to work. Use this time to to accomplish what you need to and produce something of quality.</description>
